<h1>Creative Modulation Techniques with 2hp Blur</h1>
<p>The <strong>2hp Blur</strong> is a spectral processor designed for dynamic timbral manipulation and atmospheric sound design. By leveraging its primary controls—<strong>Time</strong>, <strong>Vibe</strong>, and <strong>Mix</strong>, as well as their respective CV inputs—you can take your patches from subtle shimmer to outlandish sound mangling. Here’s how to exploit this module to design <strong>distorted percussive sounds</strong>, <strong>aggressive basslines</strong>, and <strong>haunting pads</strong>, specifically in genres like <strong>dubstep</strong>, <strong>drum &amp; bass</strong>, and cinematic/ambient music.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong>
- <strong>Input</strong>: Use a snare, kick, rimshot, or high-frequency percussion sample (or the output from a sharp synth voice such as 2hp Pluck).
- <strong>TIME</strong>: Set the <strong>Time</strong> control towards the left for minimal spectral stretching. Use a fast, random or envelope-synced CV to modulate this for glitchy, grainy hits.
    - <strong>CV Tip:</strong> Patch an envelope or stepped random CV (like from Make Noise Wogglebug or ALM Pamela’s New Workout) into <strong>Time CV</strong>. Fast attack/decay envelopes will create a snappy, grain-processed feel, while random will introduce chaotic variation.
- <strong>VIBE</strong>: Sweep the <strong>Vibe</strong> knob from clean (left) to smeared (right) to taste. For percussive distortion, modulating <strong>Vibe</strong> with velocity or accent CV from your sequencer can exaggerate timbral shifts.
    - <strong>CV Tip:</strong> Patch the accent or a pitch envelope into the <strong>Vibe CV</strong> input for each hit.
- <strong>MIX</strong>: Blend the dry/wet using <strong>Mix</strong> or automate with CV for WHIPCRACK-effect smears coming in after the transient.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Route the output through a distortion or wavefolder post-Blur for further saturation and edge.</p>

<h2>2. Crazy Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong>
- <strong>Input</strong>: Feed Blur a bass synth voice—preferably a harmonically rich wavetable, saw, or pulse wave—then sequence ground-shaking patterns.
- <strong>TIME</strong>: Use LFOs synced to your groove (fast, rhythmic rates) into <strong>Time CV</strong>. With Time fully right, Blur stretches your signal x16 for monstrous, gliding bass movement. Modulate from center to right for time-melted, re-pitched growls.
    - <strong>CV Tip:</strong> Use a stepped/random or envelope-following LFO to dynamically shift the bass between normal and time-stretched.
- <strong>VIBE</strong>: CV in with crazy envelopes or random S&amp;H to alter the harmonic spread, making your bassline morph between tight and smeared. Try fast, audio-rate modulation for digital crunch and spectral tearing.
- <strong>MIX</strong>: Rapidly automate the Mix for stuttered transitions between clean and processed bass—perfect for rhythmic gating effects.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-stack:</strong> After Blur, send into a wavefolder, filter, or even a granular reverb for extra movement before hitting your VCA.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong>
- <strong>Input</strong>: Supply Blur with a lush polyphonic pad, chord, or stacked oscillator voices (like Swarm).
- <strong>TIME</strong>: Set <strong>Time</strong> past 12 o'clock for heavy time-stretching; modulate slowly with an LFO or the output of a complex envelope (e.g., aftertouch, random voltage, or even audio from another oscillator for slow “dream-state” wow).
- <strong>VIBE</strong>: Use the knob or modulate gently with a slow triangle/sine LFO for evolving harmonic diffusion; drift from recognizable chords into shimmering, spectral clouds.
- <strong>MIX</strong>: Keep mostly wet, but with subtle automated dry return to anchor the pad occasionally. Slow, random modulations impart organic movement.</p>
<p><strong>Luxury pads:</strong> Pair Blur with stereo reverb (e.g., 2hp Verb) post-processing for immense spatial depth. Try running two Blurs in parallel (audio in, then stereo out to reverb) for dimensional pads.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Modulation Sources to Try</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequencer Mod Tracks:</strong> Assign velocity or modulation lanes to Blur’s CVs for phrase-by-phrase expression.</li>
<li><strong>LFOs (including audio-rate):</strong> Exploit both slow, smooth LFOs for evolving atmospheres and audio-rate signals for digital artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Random Generators and S&amp;H:</strong> Patch for unpredictable, organic variation.</li>
<li><strong>Envelopes (standard and non-traditional):</strong> Envelope-followers from your drums or synths add dynamic, transient-responsive changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example Chain</h2>
<p><strong>Distorted Snare:</strong></p>
<p><code>2hp Pluck (perc mode) → Blur → Drive/Distortion → Reverb</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modulate:</strong> Time CV with snare envelope; Vibe CV with accent or random; Mix with a fast square LFO</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dubstep Bassline:</strong></p>
<p><code>Complex Oscillator → Blur → Filter → VCA</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modulate:</strong> Time CV with S&amp;H or LFO synced to 16ths; Vibe CV with synced envelope; Mix with gate pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haunting Pad:</strong></p>
<p><code>2hp Swarm → Blur → 2hp Verb</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modulate:</strong> Time and Vibe with slow LFOs; gentle Mix modulation; aftertouch into Vibe CV for expressive morphs.</li>
</ul>

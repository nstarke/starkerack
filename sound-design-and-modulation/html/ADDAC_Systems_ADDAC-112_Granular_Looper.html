<h1>Creative Modulation with the ADDAC112 VC Looper &amp; Granular Processor</h1>
<p>The ADDAC112 is a powerful and flexible looper + granular processor module, offering extensive voltage control, internal modulation sources, and hands-on real-time tweakability. Below, I'll break down approaches for three sound design goals—distorted percussive sounds, wild basslines, and atmospheric pads—using unique features and modulations possible with this module.</p>
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p>Key concepts: glitch, stutter, aggressive grain settings, loop slicing, CV-driven disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Patch/Settings:</strong>
- <strong>Source</strong>: Feed a transient-rich signal (drum hit, or snappy synth hit) into the stereo/mono input.
- <strong>Record Short, Tight Loops</strong>: Use [REC NEW] to capture ultra-short drum segments (milliseconds to &lt;1s).
- <strong>Granular Engine</strong>:<br />
    - Set [GRAINS ACTIVE] to a moderate value (2–4); more grains can create fuzzier, glitchier textures.
    - Use a small [PLAY LENGTH] with high [LENGTH DEVIATION] to generate broken, stuttered grains.
    - Crank [GRAINS VOLUME] for more prominence.
    - [GRAIN LOOP DELAY]: Short but <strong>modulated by CV</strong>—use an LFO or envelope (even audio-rate for hard stutters).
    - [POSITION] + [POSITION DEVIATION]: Modulate with stepped random/S&amp;H to create retriggers or shifting slices.
- <strong>Distortion via Feedback</strong>:
    - Increase [GRAINS FEEDBACK] to route processed grains back into the looper—raise until feedback saturates for digital distortion/bitcrush.
    - Use [BIT DEPTH] at 8-bit and lower [SAMPLE RATE] in options for aliasing and lo-fi noise.
- <strong>Modulation Inputs</strong>:
    - Envelope followers for pseudo-sidechain or to “punch” in grains on each hit.
    - Step-sequencers or rhythmic triggers to glitch the [FORWARD/REVERSE] input.
    - Modulate [GRAIN REPEAT] or [REPEAT X] with randomness for stuttering ratchets.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
Metallic, glitched, and totally mangled drum textures with sharp, digital distortion and rhythmically shifting grain streams. CV modulation drives the chaos for evolving, unpredictable percussive hits.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Wild Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<p>Key concepts: aggressive pitch, looping, fast transients, hard-modded grain timing, and feedback for growl.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Patch/Settings:</strong>
- <strong>Source</strong>: Synth bass, bass guitar, or even a full mix loop as input.
- <strong>Loop Generation</strong>:
    - Sample a short, wobbly bassline riff.
    - Manipulate [LOOP PITCH] CV input with an envelope or sequencer for fast pitch sweeps/glides.
    - Switch [REC MODE] to OVERDUB with [OVERDUB DECAY] &lt;100% for evolving layers.
- <strong>Granular Engine</strong>:
    - [GRAINS ACTIVE]: 1–4 for clarity or up to 16 for wildness.
    - [POSITION] + [POSITION DEVIATION]: Use high values to scan across the bass sample.
    - [GRAIN PITCH] heavily modulated by ENV/LFO for pitch wobbles and slides; try audio-rate mod for FM-like effects.
    - [GRAIN FEEDBACK] up for saturation/growl.
    - Low [ATTACK] / short [DECAY] for snappy, percussive grains; increase [ATTACK]/[DECAY] for longer bass.
- <strong>Clocked Mode</strong>: Quantize actions to a clock for stepped, rhythmic gating or “chopped” phrasing.
- <strong>External Sequencer/Controller</strong>: Use sequencer notes to modulate [GRAIN PITCH], [LOOP PITCH], [GRAINS ACTIVE], and [DIRECTION].
- <strong>Stutter/Glitch</strong>: Trigger [RETRIG./PAUSE] or play with [GRAIN REPEAT] via CV for rapid-fire repeats.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
Thick, dynamic, and gnarly basslines with modulated digital distortion, pitch glitches, and bass “wobbles” characteristic of aggressive electronic genres.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<p>Key concepts: evolving grain clouds, long buffer, diffuse layering, spatial movement, smooth time-variance.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Patch/Settings:</strong>
- <strong>Source</strong>: Sustained vocals, field recording, drone, or chords.
- <strong>Long Buffer</strong>: Record a long (several seconds to minutes) loop to act as a granular bed.
- <strong>Granular Engine</strong>:
    - Raise [GRAINS ACTIVE] for dense layering (6-16 grains).
    - High [POSITION DEVIATION] and mid-high [LENGTH DEVIATION] so grains are offset and overlap smoothly.
    - [GRAIN LOOP DELAY]: Medium/long, modulated with random LFOs for asynchronous caress.
    - [PLAY LENGTH] long, with drifting [LENGTH DEVIATION] so some grains swell and others fade quickly.
    - [ATTACK]/[DECAY]: Medium to high for fade-in/fade out, removing artifacts and creating ethereal swells.
- <strong>Panning</strong>: Modulate [GRAIN PANNING] across the range with a random or slow LFO for immersive stereo motion.
- <strong>Feedback</strong>: Gentle [GRAINS FEEDBACK] for dreamy, evolving soundscapes, but avoid over-saturating unless you want swirling distortion.
- <strong>Sample Rate &amp; Bit Depth</strong>: 16bit, 44.1k or 48k for cleaner pads; drop to 8bit/11k for lo-fi, ghostly atmospheres.
- <strong>CV Modulation</strong>: Slowly modulated random signals to [POSITION], [LENGTH], [GRAINS ACTIVE], and [PANNING] keep textures alive and morphing.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
Lush, shimmering, and ever-evolving pads; clouds of grains move ghostlike through stereo space and pitch, perfect for dark ambient or cinematic backgrounds.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Modulation Ideas At-a-Glance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>LFOs</strong>: To any CV input for cyclical movement (pitch, grain size, position, direction, repeat).</li>
<li><strong>Random/S&amp;H</strong>: For unpredictable slice/position, glitch, and panning.</li>
<li><strong>Envelopes</strong>: Dynamic accents, especially for tight percussives and expressive pads.</li>
<li><strong>Sequencers</strong>: Melodic pitch quantization, rhythmic loop changes, glitch repetition.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-rate</strong>: Use for wild, aliasing-rich AM/FM effects via CV inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Manual</strong>: Real-time hands-on tweaks + CV for live performance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the [PRESET] system to quickly jump between drastically different modulation “scenes.”</li>
<li>Save/Load banks for instant recall in live setups.</li>
<li>Use external mults and stackcables to send one modulation source to multiple CV inputs for complex correlation.</li>
</ul>

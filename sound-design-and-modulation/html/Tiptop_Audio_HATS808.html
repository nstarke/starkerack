<h1>Creative Modulation Strategies for Tiptop Audio HATS808</h1>
<p><em>Analysis by a Eurorack Synthesist</em></p>
<p>The Tiptop Audio HATS808 is a deep, analog hi-hat module with many unique modulation opportunities. With its added voltage-controlled resonance (Q/VC-Q), enhanced gain staging, and independent accent control, it is capable of far more than classic hi-hat duties. Let’s dive into ways you can leverage this module for distorted percussion, warped dubstep/drum &amp; bass basslines, and eerie atmospheric textures.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<h4>Utilize the Overdrive (HOT GAIN)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEVEL Knob:</strong> Set the LEVEL to max; this pushes the output into hot, saturated territory.</li>
<li><strong>ACCENT Knob:</strong> Also max this out, or modulate with high-velocity triggers for further punch and harmonics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>External Clipping/Distortion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch the HATS808 output into an external wavefolder, distortion, or even guitar pedals for increased bite.</li>
</ul>
<h4>VC-Q Modulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use an LFO or envelope to modulate the VC-Q input. Rapid, snappy envelopes (from maths/function generators) will cause the band-pass filter resonance to sweep, creating metallic, tearing or “laser-like” textures.</li>
<li>You can also try audio-rate modulation (patch an oscillator into VC-Q). This will create ring-mod and digital/bitcrush-style artifacts due to the filter entering self-oscillation and chaotic behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Choke &amp; Accent Tricks</h4>
<ul>
<li>For rhythmic stutters, sequence repeated CH triggers with offset or random accents. Use accent modulation to induce unpredictably distorted, clipped attacks on some beats.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Crazy Bassline Generation (Dubstep/DnB)</h2>
<h4>BandPass Out for Bass</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>BandPass OUT</strong> as a raw oscillator: Patch it into a VCA, filter, and envelope controlled by your sequencer.</li>
<li>Crank the Q knob—when past a certain point, the internal filter begins to oscillate. Try holding the Open Hat for longer decays; this produces a droning, bassy tone that’s somewhere between a kick, snare, and metallic waveform.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Audio-Rate VC-Q FM</h4>
<ul>
<li>Feed a VCO or noise source into the VC-Q input. With high Q settings, the band-pass filter will track this CV, giving you aggressive, vocal/squelchy or growling bass—especially effective if clock-synced to your sequencer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Envelope Modulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mult a drum envelope or LFO to the VC-Q; sweep the Q at bass rates for wobble bass. Longer envelopes modulating Q give you strong moving bass textures—just like dubstep wobs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Extreme Choke Disabling</h4>
<ul>
<li>Disable choke on the HATS808 (jumper on PCB as described). This allows the Open Hat/“bass oscillator” to decay fully, sustaining distorted tones—good for droning notes or basses.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Atmospheric Pad/Texture Design</h2>
<h4>BandPass Raw Source</h4>
<ul>
<li>The BandPass OUT is a wonderful metallic/spectral sound source. Run it into a long-decay envelope-controlled VCA, reverb, and/or granular modules for textural pad layers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>VC-Q with Slow Modulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch a slow LFO, envelope follower (from a field mic, contact mic, etc.), or S&amp;H into VC-Q for gentle, evolving changes in resonance—making shimmering or haunting sound beds.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Self-Oscillation Drones</h4>
<ul>
<li>Push Q to self-oscillation territory. Carefully tune the decay/hold with external envelopes. Add reverb and delay for cavernous, bell-like atmospheres.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Feedback Loop</h4>
<ul>
<li>Route the output of BandPass OUT back into a mixer channel, and route some of this back into the VC-Q, optionally passing through a delay or phaser first. Carefully controlled, this feedback creates eerie, evolving metallic atmospheres.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Bonus Utility: External Modulation and Processing</h3>
<ul>
<li>HATS808 responds well to CV from unusual sources:</li>
<li><strong>Random Voltages/S&amp;H:</strong> For unpredictable timbral shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Followers:</strong> To impart movement from external audio into the percussive sound.</li>
<li><strong>Sequencer Gates/CV:</strong> For classic rhythmic modulation of ACCENT, LEVEL, and VC-Q.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patch Examples</h3>
<pre><code class="language-text">* Distorted Perc Shot:
  OH OUT → Overdrive → Mixer
  ACCENT IN: Envelope with peak at attack

* Wobble Bass:
  BANDPASS OUT → VCA → Filter
  VC-Q IN: Sine VCO (audio-rate)
  Decay: Long

* Haunting Pad:
  BANDPASS OUT → VCA (long envelope) → Reverb → Output
  VC-Q IN: Slow S&amp;H or LFO
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Explore unconventional patching—remember, modulation is key to unique timbres. The HATS808 isn’t just a hi-hat, it’s a wild source of analog energy for the curious.</p>

<h2>Creative Modulation Techniques with the 2hp Switch</h2>
<p>The <strong>2hp Switch</strong> is a compact, voltage-controlled signal router with four inputs and one output—an excellent utility for experimental signal processing in Eurorack setups. Below are detailed strategies for using this module to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distorted percussive sounds  </li>
<li>Crazy, modulated basslines (dubstep/DnB style)  </li>
<li>Haunting, evolving atmospheric pads  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h3>
<p><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Channel-Hop Drum Layering</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Patch 4 different percussive sources (e.g., Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Digitally-distorted Noise Burst) to the four Switch inputs.</li>
<li><strong>SEL CV Input:</strong> Send a fast, stepped random voltage (e.g., from a Turing Machine, Sample &amp; Hold, or sequencer set to gate mode) into the SEL CV input.</li>
<li><strong>SEL Knob:</strong> Use this to offset or "window" which drum types are being accessed in each phrase.</li>
<li><strong>Processing:</strong> Route Switch’s output through a distortion, wavefolder, bitcrusher, or even just heavy VCA gain for further smash-and-glitch artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
The Switch will instantly jump between percussive sounds on each step, creating highly unpredictable, glitchy drum lines perfect for breakcore or industrial genres.</p>
<p><strong>Variation:</strong><br />
- Patch only <em>varied</em> distorted sources, and CV-sequence the selection for unpredictable, ever-morphing percussion.
- Use audio-rate CVs (fast LFOs or oscillators) into SEL CV for rapid aliasing/granular chopping, creating digital artifacts.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Crazy Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h3>
<p><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Bassline Chopper</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Patch four different bass sound generators (e.g., classic sub, FM bass, formant oscillator, filtered noise bass) into the Switch.</li>
<li><strong>SEL CV Input:</strong> Use a complex modulation source, such as:</li>
<li>A quantized random sequence synced to your clock</li>
<li>An LFO multiplied and phase-shifted for wobbles</li>
<li>Envelope follower from a drum track to "key" bass selection to drum hits</li>
<li><strong>SEL Knob:</strong> Manually sweep during recording/jamming for live glitch effects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
Generate "mutating" bass lines that rapidly morph character, reminiscent of chopped, re-sampled modern DnB/Dubstep bass sound. Audio-rate SEL CV modulation transforms the Switch into a digital waveshaper, causing wild, stuttering, bit-crushed edges!</p>
<p><strong>Variation:</strong><br />
- Use the SEL CV input with stepped voltages that align with your musical phrases for rhythmic precision.
- Modulate SEL CV with sidechained pumping for creative movement.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Haunting, Atmospheric Pads</h3>
<p><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Textural Morphing</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Patch four evolving drones or pad textures (sample playback, slowly modulated oscillators, granular clouds, etc.) to Switch inputs.</li>
<li><strong>SEL CV Input:</strong> Slowly modulate with an LFO, envelope, or manually-played voltage source (e.g., joystick, ribbon controller), or a super-slow random source.</li>
<li><strong>SEL Knob:</strong> Set the offset to bias certain textures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
As the SEL CV sweeps, the module cross-switches between different pad sources abruptly (as opposed to crossfading), resulting in a textural, cinematic soundscape with haunting jumps—great for ambient, experimental, or horror sound design.</p>
<p><strong>Variation:</strong><br />
- Use the input LEDs for visual feedback, syncing texture changes to stage lighting/visuals.
- Modulate SEL CV with envelopes triggered alongside filter sweeps for synchronized movement.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Additional Creative Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use gates or triggers to the SEL CV for instant, precise switching: great for live fills or breakdowns.</li>
<li>Run CV signals themselves through the Switch (as opposed to audio). Use separate CV sequences for each input—modulate the selection for complex, algorithmic, generative modulation sources.</li>
<li>Stack the output with a VCA and reverb for further dynamic and spatial manipulation.</li>
</ul>

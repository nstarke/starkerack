<h1>Modulation Strategies for Kaona Stereoweaver</h1>
<p><em>Eurorack Techniques for Percussion, Bass, and Haunting Pads</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Stereoweaver module isn't just a “stereo widener.” Its clever use of depth, phase, micro-delays (Haas), animated panning, and simulated rotary effects allows for powerful sound shaping. Below are some modulation tips and patches specifically geared toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distorted percussive hits  </li>
<li>Unhinged basslines for dubstep/DnB  </li>
<li>Haunting pads  </li>
</ul>
<p>All suggestions below assume you have access to external modulation sources (LFOs, Envelopes, Sequencers, etc.) and patch cables.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Tight, aggressive stereo sound with distortion, percussive movement, and coloration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Gain:</strong> Push the input gain until the clip LED blinks (or stays on). This induces pleasing analog distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Depth:</strong> Set medium-high to increase the interaction of spatial effects, introducing phase/chorus artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Assign a sharp, fast envelope (from your kick/snare envelope) to the Motion CV. Fast attack/release creates animated “surge” in stereo movement with every hit. Try the “Rotary” mode for rolling, shattered transients.</li>
<li><strong>Haas:</strong> Use a decayed envelope or synced stepped CV to modulate Haas. Snappy modulation gives a “slap-back” character, exaggerating percussive attack.</li>
<li><strong>Phase:</strong> Modulate with a slow random LFO or stepped CV to shift the character between hits, making each percussive note subtly different.</li>
<li><strong>Width:</strong> Keep this moderate, but use another envelope for occasional “ghost” widening at the end of percussive bursts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pro Tip</em>: Envelope followers from the drum can modulate Haas or Phase so that harder hits widen and smear more, making complex transients.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Wide, animated, and at times chaotic bass, combining movement and timbral evolution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Gain:</strong> Push until just before heavy clipping, for grit. For “growls,” you can allow some saturation/distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Depth:</strong> Higher settings, for more enveloping, organic texture; sweep with a slow LFO for living stereo.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Use an LFO synced to your sequencer to modulate Motion between slow and fast. “Rotary” mode creates swirling, Leslie-like movement that's excellent when processed with filtering/distortion after Stereoweaver.</li>
<li><strong>Haas:</strong> Automate with a squelchy, audio-rate LFO or sample &amp; hold for jittery, erratic stereo effect. Sudden Haas changes “shake” the basslines out of the center.</li>
<li><strong>Phase:</strong> Assign a random or slow evolving LFO. Changing Phase will “tilt” the stereo image, making the bass weave left to right.</li>
<li><strong>Width:</strong> Automate with CV, possibly using accent triggers from your bass sequencer for sudden “side” expansion on particular notes, making lines jump out.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pro Tip</em>: Insert Stereoweaver before a distortion device—the stereo modulation interacts strongly with classic overdrive or wavefolder modules.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Lush, evolving, and sometimes eerie stereo fields for ambient/film textures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Gain:</strong> Clean or subtle warmth; avoid heavy clipping for maximum stereo clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Depth:</strong> High, sweeping with very slow LFOs for continuous morphing.</li>
<li><strong>Motion:</strong> Use a very slow, smooth LFO; in “Rotary” mode, the stereo field will swirl slowly, emulating a slowly spinning speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Haas:</strong> Modulate with a subtle, drifting LFO. Micro-fluctuations mean the pad never sits still; it feels alive.</li>
<li><strong>Phase:</strong> Very slow LFOs or random generators, or even manually sweeping on occasion for dramatic moments.</li>
<li><strong>Width:</strong> Maxed for total immersion, but automate reduction occasionally (with CV) for moments where the sound “focuses” to mono for musical tension.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pro Tip</em>: Send long, evolving modulation envelopes from complex LFOs or random voltage generators to every available CV input. Modulate Depth, Haas, Width, Phase, and Motion differently for endless subtle variations.</p>

<h2>Final Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Multimodulation:</strong> Use multiple simultaneous CVs for evolving, complex soundscapes; for example, LFOs to Depth/Width, envelopes to Motion/Haas.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Processing:</strong> Stereoweaver is perfect before/during feedback loops or after reverbs for thick, swirling spaces.</li>

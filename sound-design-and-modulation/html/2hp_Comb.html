<h1>Creative Modulation Guide for the 2hp Comb Eurorack Module</h1>
<p>The 2hp Comb is a powerful, compact IIR peaking comb filter. With its cutoff frequency, resonance (capable of self-oscillation), feedback dampening, and abundant CV control, it offers a vast palette for sound design. Below, I've highlighted strategies to harness those features for unique <strong>distorted percussive sounds</strong>, <strong>aggressive basslines</strong>, and <strong>haunting pads</strong>. Each approach focuses on creative use of the module’s parameters and CV inputs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Module CV Points &amp; Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>FREQ CV Input:</strong> Controls cutoff/delay time (<code>±5V</code>)</li>
<li><strong>RES CV Input:</strong> Controls resonance/feedback (<code>±5V</code>)</li>
<li><strong>DAMP CV Input:</strong> Controls feedback path dampening (<code>±5V</code>)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create sharply attacked, metallic or shredded drum hits and glitch artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Route clicks, short envelopes, or white noise bursts to <strong>IN</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>FREQ Control:</strong> Use a fast, snappy envelope or even trigger pulses via the <strong>FREQ CV In</strong> to sweep the cutoff at audio rate. This will cause intense, sometimes metallic transients—ideal for aggressive percussive timbres.</li>
<li><strong>RES Control:</strong> Crank the <strong>RES</strong> knob high (or modulate it with a steep envelope) so the comb filter teeters into self-oscillation when percussive signals hit. This adds harmonic clang (like hitting a metal plate).</li>
<li><strong>DAMP:</strong> Use a sharp envelope in <strong>DAMP CV In</strong> to briefly <em>open</em> the damp (fully clockwise) on attack, then <em>close</em> it (counterclockwise) to darken the decay. This creates “pingy” or splattering decay tails.</li>
<li><strong>Add Feedback:</strong> Turn up <strong>RES</strong> and use the <strong>DAMP</strong> control to push feedback into self-oscillation right as a percussive sound hits, then clamp it down to avoid runaway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Modulate all three parameters (Freq, Res, Damp) simultaneously with different envelopes or stepped random voltages to create evolving, unpredictable percussion.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/DnB Style)</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ridiculously resonant, growling, “torn” basses with moving peaks and synthetic character.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Feed in a simple sub-oscillator (triangle, saw, or pulse) or dirty noise.</li>
<li><strong>FREQ CV:</strong> Use an LFO or sequencer track to modulate FREQ rapidly. Fast LFOs (audio-rate modulation) can create vowel-like, formant shifting growls.</li>
<li><strong>RES:</strong> Set high for squealing, overtone-rich peaks. Try modulating <strong>RES</strong> with a square or stepped random voltage to make the resonance jump or “chirp.”</li>
<li><strong>DAMP:</strong> Animate DAMP with an LFO or envelope inversely to resonance—e.g., when resonance goes up, damp opens, then vice versa. This keeps the sound moving and lively without overpowering feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Oscillation:</strong> Push feedback to self-oscillation and modulate <strong>FREQ</strong> with envelopes or pitch CV. The result is a “re-triggered,” morphing resonator that can breathe and snarl—classic for neuro/DnB reese basses and dubstep growls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> For even more movement, mult a sequencer or random source to several CV inputs so all parameters move in complex, interrelated ways.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ethereal, otherworldly washes with fluttering harmonics and evolving textures.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Feed in sustained drones, chordal samples, or even slow granular textures.</li>
<li><strong>FREQ:</strong> Slowly modulate FREQ with a slow LFO or random smooth voltage (e.g., Turing Machine, Wogglebug). This adds subtly moving harmonic notches and peaks for evolving character.</li>
<li><strong>RES:</strong> Set to medium for gentle resonances. Use a secondary slow LFO to drift RES for swelling/receding harmonic emphasis—think of wind, breath, or shifting pitches in a cave.</li>
<li><strong>DAMP:</strong> Modulate DAMP gently around the mid-point with long, irregular envelopes or smooth random signals. The resulting brightness/darkness fluctuation brings morphing timbral shifts, akin to environmental motion.</li>
<li><strong>Serial Processing:</strong> Chain the Comb after a reverb or before a shimmer reverb to amplify the ghostly spatial effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance Tip:</strong> Use manual tweaking of all three knobs during a performance; slight, coordinated changes in FREQ, RES, and DAMP can lead a pad from serene to ominous to radiant with minimal patch changes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p><strong>General Tips:</strong>
- Use audio-rate signals in CV inputs for wild FM-style effects.
- Combine with wavefolders, distortions, or bitcrushers for harsher sound design.
- Add subtle modulation for organic-sounding textures, or harsh stepped voltage for destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
The 2hp Comb excels as a timbre-warping creative tool. Its full CV control means you can sculpt audio far more dynamically than with fixed filters—use it for impact, movement, and atmosphere.</p>

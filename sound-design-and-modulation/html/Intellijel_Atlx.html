<h2>Creative Modulation Techniques for the <strong>Atlantix + Atlx Expander</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Intellijel Atlantix</strong> paired with the <strong>Atlx Expander</strong> unlocks deep sound design possibilities with its dual oscillators, multi-mode filter, VCA, ADSR, and a wealth of patch points—including the new dedicated waveform/filter outs and ring modulator from Atlx. Below you’ll find modulation concepts and patch ideas tuned for percussive distortion, wild basses (think dubstep/DnB), and lush, eerie pads.</p>

<h3>1. <strong>Distorted Percussive Sounds</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Patch Idea: "Ring-Mod Drum Machine"</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oscillator Setup:</strong> Mult the envelope to both VCA level and oscillator pitch—snappy envelope for punch.</li>
<li><strong>Ring Modulator:</strong> Patch different waveforms (e.g., Saw and Sine from Osc A/B) into X In and Y In. Take the <strong>RING Out</strong> as your main output—this adds metallic, bell-like, or tearing distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Filter Distortion:</strong> Send output through both <strong>Lowpass</strong> and <strong>Phazor</strong> filter outs to a mixer; drive the filter hard with hot envelopes or modulate filter cutoff with fast random/LFO for a gritty, almost bit-reduced feel.</li>
<li><strong>Extra Touch:</strong> Modulate VCO B’s PWM input with audio-rate signal from VCO A for classic analog "click" and digital noise artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>2. <strong>Crazy Basslines (Dubstep, Drum &amp; Bass)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Patch Idea: "Talking Bass Monster"</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>BasS VCO:</strong> Take <strong>Sub Square (A)</strong> and <strong>Saw (B)</strong> outs, mix externally or FM one with the other.</li>
<li><strong>Filter Animation:</strong> Modulate <strong>filter cutoff</strong> with a multistage envelope or steep LFO for “wobble.” Try using fast random stepped modulation for more DnB flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Ring Modulator Resynthesis:</strong> Use the <strong>RING Out</strong> instead of direct oscillator out for gnarlier, formant-like overtones.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Patching:</strong> Patch the <strong>Highpass</strong> out to another VCA, then modulate the VCA with an audio-rate source or envelope, adding mid-high sizzle.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Route a copy of the audio through the <strong>Paazor</strong> out, sum with the dry signal for extra phasing/smeared dirt.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>3. <strong>Haunting Atmospheric Pads</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Patch Idea: "Ghost Drift"</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detuned Oscillators:</strong> Use both A and B, slightly detuned, with different waveform outs (Triangle+Sine) mixed.</li>
<li><strong>Filter Movement:</strong> Patch slow LFOs or random voltage to filter cutoff via <strong>Lowpass</strong> and <strong>Bandpass</strong> outs simultaneously for movement.</li>
<li><strong>Ring Mod Texture:</strong> Send a slow LFO or another oscillator’s sine wave into the ring mod with your pad for evolving, subtle metallic tails. Add <strong>Phazor</strong> out to your mix to introduce swirling, phasey movement.</li>
<li><strong>Subtle Distortion:</strong> Gently overdrive the filter by increasing input levels or mixing in some <strong>Saw</strong> with <strong>Sub Square</strong> and process the result through <strong>Bandpass</strong> out for narrow “whistling” effects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Bonus Modulation Tips w/ Atlx</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>PWM Animation:</strong> Use LFO or audio-rate modulation on Osc A’s PWM (Square wave) for timbral shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Self-FM and Filter Feedback:</strong> Patch a filter out (e.g., <strong>Bandpass</strong>) back into the FM input on a VCO or the filter’s own input for chaotic, unstable sounds.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Sculpting:</strong> Mult the ADSR to multiple destinations (VCA, filter, osc pitch, ring mod input) for complex percussive effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leverage the <strong>Atlx expander’s 16 dedicated outputs</strong> for advanced cross-patching, multi-layered modulation, and integrating with external modules—turning the Atlantix into a true sound design laboratory.</p>

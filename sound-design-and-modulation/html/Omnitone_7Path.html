<h2>Creative Sound Design with the 7Path Ethernet Patch Cable Bridge</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <strong>7Path</strong> from Omnitone isn’t a traditional sound-shaping module—rather, it’s a unique utility that allows you to bridge signals between Eurorack cases or distant regions of your modular setup using a single Ethernet cable. It is passive and features seven 1:1 jack pairs (e.g., Jack 4 out = Jack 4 in on the partner module), letting you route <em>any</em> type of signal, audio or CV, with no restriction on directionality. This opens up creative patching possibilities, especially for grouping, inter-case modulation, and chaotic feedback networks.</p>
<p>Below are ways to use the 7Path to help sculpt distinctive percussive timbres, aggressive basslines, and chilling ambient pads. For each sound-type, inspiration is given on integrating the 7Path into your modular workflow.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Use 7Path to create harsh feedback loops, CV cross-modulation, and signal rerouting—enabling distortion, noisy transients, and "circuit bent"-like glitches.</p>
<h3>Patch Ideas:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedback Network:</strong> Patch the output of a drum module or burst generator into an effect (distortion, wavefolder, filter), then route the processed signal via 7Path back into an input on the drum's modulation (e.g., pitch, decay, or trigger input). Adjust feedback intensity with an attenuator or VCA inline.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Case Chaos:</strong> Send audio from a drum voice in one case through 7Path into a totally different FX module in another case, then back through another 7Path channel. This facilitates long, multi-case feedback paths, which can get wild.</li>
<li><strong>CV Disruption:</strong> Run different envelope or random CV sources into various modulation points of a percussive module, using 7Path to maximize cable reach and case separation. Cross-patch envelopes to unexpected destinations for morphing transients.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Crazy Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Unsync your mod sources and audio processors using 7Path to route signals in unconventional patterns, especially to create moving, distorted, and "talking" bass.</p>
<h3>Patch Ideas:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>VCO-to-Filter Distortion:</strong> Route your bass VCO’s audio through a saturated filter or wavefolder in another case, return it via 7Path. Simultaneously, send aggressive LFO or envelope CV over another channel, modulating filter cutoff from a different clock or random source.</li>
<li><strong>Layered Modulations:</strong> Send multiple LFOs, envelopes, or even audio-rate signals through 7Path to modulate FM inputs, filter cutoff, distortion, etc. This breaks the boundaries of "local" modulation and results in shifting, non-repetitive wobbles.</li>
<li><strong>Buss Resampling:</strong> Send the output of a processing chain through 7Path and feed it back into a sampler or looper for resampling. Perfect for DnB reese basses or spectral madness.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Use 7Path to splice subtle modulations and feedback paths between distant effect chains—building complexity and eerie movement.</p>
<h3>Patch Ideas:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow Modulation Busses:</strong> Pass slow LFOs or S&amp;H CV via 7Path to distant filters, VCAs, or wave morphers. Layer these in effects-heavy chains (e.g., big verbs or delays) for shimmering pads.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Case Texture:</strong> Send audio through granular/reverb modules in one case, route wet/dry mix back via 7Path to filter or phaser elsewhere. Create self-generating or slowly evolving textures by patching multiple feedback loops.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Modulation Matrix:</strong> Use 7Path as a modulation bus—multiple modulation sources in one case can reach destinations in another, animating long drone or pad patches with mysterious, never-the-same movement.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Bonus Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>passive signal path</strong> means you can pass audio, CV, even triggers/gates—but signal loss can occur over long/unshielded cables, so compensate with signal boosters if needed.</li>
<li>No power required—use as a modular "patchbay."</li>
<li>You aren't limited to just case-to-case; use it to declutter large cases or for creative cross-row patching.</li>
<li>The <strong>one-to-one jack mapping</strong> preserves signal order, making complex multi-signal feedback and routing much easier to manage.</li>
</ul>

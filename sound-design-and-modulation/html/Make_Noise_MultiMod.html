<h1>Make Noise MultiMod Creative Modulation Tips</h1>
<p>Below are focused strategies for patching the Make Noise <strong>MultiMod</strong> to generate distorted percussion, complex wobble basslines, and evolving atmospheric pads, based on your manual’s features and tips:</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stepped Random Shapes:</strong>  </li>
<li>Select the Orange "Stepped Random" shape. This generates abrupt voltage changes at each channel, perfect for glitchy and unpredictable percussive elements.</li>
<li>Modulate the <strong>Time</strong> parameter with audio-rate CV for extra aliasing and digital artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Hold Function:</strong>  </li>
<li>Use the <strong>Hold</strong> feature, activated by a gate from another module, to freeze and loop transient CV bursts, turning smooth envelopes into sharp, ghostly repeats—excellent for metallic or stuttered percussion.</li>
<li><strong>Spread + Time for Transient Smearing:</strong>  </li>
<li>Set <strong>Spread</strong> away from noon so channels are running at various speeds—some sped up, some slowed-down versions of the same trigger CV. Run outputs to percussive voice decay or distortion amount.  </li>
<li>Modulate <strong>Time</strong> manually or via CV for shifted, smeared percussive impacts resembling industrial hits.</li>
<li><strong>Square Shape as Pulses:</strong>  </li>
<li>With nothing patched to Signal In, use Pink “Square” shape for clocked pulses (variable divisions/multiples at outputs), then run each into VCA amplitude or filter cutoff—all will hit at different times.  </li>
<li>Drive results through a wavefolder or hard clipping for digital overtones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Example:</strong><br />
Noise source → MultiMod Signal In; set Shape = Stepped Random; Spread = maximal; outputs to VCA CVs or drum parameters; modulate Time from an envelope or audio-rate oscillator; trigger Hold with snare/rim/click for frozen glitch accents.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>2. Crazy Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase Ablation:</strong>  </li>
<li>Use the <strong>Phase</strong> parameter to steadily modulate the relative timings of each bass movement. Assign a synced LFO or envelope into Phase CV in, and automate the knob for shifting, warping bass waves.</li>
<li><strong>Internal LFO Mode:</strong>  </li>
<li>Leave Signal In empty—set the read Shape to <strong>Sine, Ramp, or Triangle</strong>. Use Time and Spread to generate wobbly, ever-changing movement.  </li>
<li>CV control Time with your sequencer’s gate or accent output for rhythmic “woof” or growling bass pulses.</li>
<li><strong>Spread for Harmonic Wobble:</strong>  </li>
<li>Set Spread so some channels move faster and others slower—patch several outputs to different oscillator FM inputs, filter cutoff, or wavefolder depth. Their combined modulation will sound like a “herd” of LFOs running at clock-divided rates.</li>
<li><strong>Sync and Resync:</strong>  </li>
<li>Patch a Reset gate synced to your main drum rhythm into MultiMod’s Reset input. This keeps the mad bass movements locked to drops or rhythmic cadences—great for fills and wild “reset” effects.</li>
<li><strong>Glitchy “Tape Head” Play:</strong>  </li>
<li>Try “Ramplets” (Yellow) or “Ping-Pong” (Blue) shape for non-linear, backwards, or two-way playback—this creates unpredictable, wonky bass phrases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Example:</strong><br />
MultiMod output 1 → main bass VCO FM; output 2 → filter cutoff; output 3 → VCA; Shape = Purple (Sine) or Blue (Ping Pong); modulate Spread with an envelope; Reset triggered each 4/8 bars for repeatable drop wobbles; control Time with a modulated LFO for dynamic energy.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smooth Random or Sine LFOs:</strong>  </li>
<li>Set Shape to “Ramplets” (Yellow) or “Sine” (Purple)—with no signal in, get eight organically drifting LFOs.</li>
<li>Patch outputs to stereo imaging modules, filter resonance, reverb diffusion, or VCA amplitude for constantly evolving movement.</li>
<li><strong>High Spread, Slow Time:</strong>  </li>
<li>Set Spread to a high value (not at noon), and turn Time up (CW). Now each output evolves at its own rate, creating extended, non-repeating envelopes that can drift for minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereal “Tape Loop” Trick:</strong>  </li>
<li>Use Hold to lock in a frozen modulation state, then slowly scan through Phase or Spread—patch resulting CVs to granular parameters, shimmer pitch, or reverb morphing for a woozy, submerged vibe.</li>
<li><strong>Tempo Sync for Rhythmic Drones:</strong>  </li>
<li>Patch in a slow external clock to Tempo In; now all channels drift but periodically re-align. Good for pads that “breathe” in sync but never repeat precisely.</li>
<li><strong>Spatial Movement:</strong>  </li>
<li>Channel Index out can be used to automate which of your eight pad voices (or audio effects) is emphasized, slowly moving spectral focus across your mix.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Example:</strong><br />
MultiMod outputs 1-8 → different voices’ filters and VCAs. Shape = Sine or Ramplets. Time = long. Spread = wide. Modulate Spread and Phase with S&amp;H LFO or slow envelope. Option: Use Reset to periodically return drifting modulations to unity, momentarily aligning all layers for a “phantom orchestra” effect.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>General Pro Tips</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abuse Modulation:</strong><ul>
<li>Patch audio-rate or random CVs into Phase/Spread/Time to push the MultiMod into digital distortion and glitch territory.</li>
<li>Extreme (beyond panel) CV values take channels up to x24 or /24 speeds for digital “shred.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tempo and Reset:</strong><ul>
<li>Sync to external clocks/sequencers for musical control, or deliberately disrupt with offbeat Resets for organized chaos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CV Mixing:</strong><ul>
<li>Mix outputs with CV processors or crossfaders for morphing between movements.</li>
<li>Use outputs to modulate effects (delay, reverb, bitcrusher) for modulation across the FX tail, not just dry sound.</li>
</ul>

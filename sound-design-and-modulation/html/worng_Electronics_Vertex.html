<h1>Creative Modulation Techniques for the WORNG Electronics Vertex</h1>
<p>The Vertex is a powerful and flexible stereo VCA that goes far beyond basic stereo amplitude control. Leveraging its unique architecture—featuring both linear and exponential VCAs, wide-ranging gain CV response, and voltage-controllable stereo skew—you can shape, mangle, and animate audio and CV signals in truly unique ways.</p>
<p>Below, I’ll outline techniques focused on three areas:<br />
- <strong>Distorted Percussive Sounds</strong><br />
- <strong>Aggressive Basslines (Dubstep/DnB style)</strong><br />
- <strong>Haunting Atmospheric Pads</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<h4><strong>Overdriven Envelope Shaping</strong></h4>
<p>Vertex’s special 3320 VCA choice means that pushing the gain CV <em>over</em> unity produces <em>envelope clipping</em>—not audio distortion, but a pseudo-hard-limiting effect on your envelopes. This tweaks the envelope shape from an AD to something more like an AHD, great for punchy percussive attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Idea:</strong>
- Send a fast, snappy envelope (from a Maths, Quadrax, or similar) into the <strong>Gain CV Input</strong>.
- Crank the <strong>Gain CV Amount</strong> up <em>past</em> the point that fully opens the VCAs. The envelope peaks will clip, shortening the attack and adding an instantaneous “hold” stage—a pseudo-transient.
- Patch a mono drum (kick/snare) hit into the <strong>L Input</strong>.<br />
- Modulate <strong>Skew</strong> (manually or with a random/stepped CV) so the left and right channels clip at different points—producing asymmetric transients. This can make percussive hits sound wider and more aggressive.</p>
<h4><strong>Stereo Crush and Fatten</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Use two different envelopes into <strong>Gain CV</strong> and <strong>Skew CV</strong>, or patch the same envelope inverted to Skew CV Amount.  </li>
<li>The result is each channel having a <em>different</em> clipped envelope shape—almost like two drums layered, but interleaved across the stereo spectrum.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass)</h2>
<h4><strong>Voltage-Controlled Panning + Overdriven CV for Bass Distortion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Send a gnarly bass oscillator into the <strong>L Input</strong> (keep R unpatched for mono-to-stereo).</li>
<li>Max out the <strong>Gain</strong> knob to ensure the signal is always passing.</li>
<li>Use a rhythmic, fast envelope (from a sequencer or synchronized LFO) into the <strong>Gain CV Input</strong>, set Gain CV Amount to just over full (to ensure some clipping).</li>
<li>Now patch an LFO or step sequence (sync’d to your drum groove) into <strong>Skew CV</strong>. As the bass follows your envelope, it dynamically “jumps” or warps across the stereo field.</li>
<li>For extreme “talking” bass, modulate <strong>Skew CV Amount</strong> with audio-rate modulation (FM), low and deep for wobble or high and noisy for artifact-filled aggression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong>
- Run a CV from your pitch sequencer (transposed down an octave) into the <strong>Gain CV</strong> input. Now the amount of “clipping” follows the bass pitch, enhancing low notes and creating pseudo-dynamic distortion.</p>
<h4><strong>Bitcrushed Stereo Movement</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Use a stepped random or sample-and-hold signal patched to Skew CV at audio rate.</li>
<li>This makes the Left and Right envelopes randomly clip, resulting in a chaotic, aliased stereo motion—great for DnB reese lines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<h4><strong>Slow Stereo Animation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch a lush pad (complex chord or drone) into <strong>L Input</strong>.</li>
<li>Use very slow, offset LFOs (or smooth random CV) into <strong>Skew CV</strong>—this causes the signal to drift dreamily between left and right.</li>
<li>Run another LFO into <strong>Gain CV</strong>, with the <strong>Gain CV Amount</strong> lower, so only subtle overall swells occur.</li>
<li>Subtle envelope overdrive (set Gain CV Amount so envelope peaks are <em>just</em> clipped) adds an unpredictable "hold" to one channel at a time, swelling the stereo field in ghostly, unnatural ways.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Granular, Drifting Swells</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch a granular synth or reverb tail into <strong>Vertex</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <em>offset</em> and slowly modulated voltages for both Gain and Skew.  </li>
<li>Invert and cross-modulate slow random voltages (use a VC Polarizer/Attenuverter) into <strong>Gain CV Amount</strong> and <strong>Skew CV Amount</strong>.  </li>
<li>The stereo image will breathe and morph, with unpredictable “ghost” swells due to the unique clipping of the CVs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Pro-Tip: CV Processing</h2>
<p>Vertex is <strong>DC-coupled</strong>, so you can use these same techniques on control voltages (LFOs/envelopes/sequences) as well as audio, creating complex, stereo, cross-modulated envelopes or modulation signals for downstream modules—making your stereo modulation as lively as your audio.</p>
<hr />
<p>Explore these techniques and you’ll discover the Vertex is far more than a VCA: it’s a hands-on sculptor of envelopes, gates, amplitude, and stereo movement.</p>

<h2>BLM Voks Analog Filter — Creative Modulation Techniques</h2>
<p>The <strong>BLM Voks Analog Filter</strong> is a Polivoks-style Eurorack filter with some unique features, including multiple filter modes, an internal diode limiter, and a switchable "Unstable Brite" mode. Here’s how you can modulate this filter to generate the kinds of sounds you’re after:</p>
<h3>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h3>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong><br />
- <strong>Drive the Inputs:</strong> Send hot drum sounds or sharp envelopes into the <strong>Direct Audio Input</strong>. The internal limiter diode, engaged by the switch, will clip and saturate the signal.
- <strong>Unstable Brite Mode:</strong> Switch to Brite mode for even more aggressive, unstable filtering — perfect for distortion or unpredictable percussive artifacts.
- <strong>FM Input:</strong> Patch an envelope or stepped random CV (from a sequencer or sample &amp; hold) into the <strong>Bi-polar FM input</strong>. Push the FM depth for wild, clangy overtones and pitch-sweep effects. Drum triggers through an envelope into FM can cause “snapping” filter cutoff changes.
- <strong>CV Direct Input:</strong> Use extremely fast, snappy envelopes into the CV input to create filter “thwacks” for each percussive hit.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br />
Mult your drum or percussion audio to both filter inputs ("Attenuated Audio In" and "Direct Audio In") at different levels to saturate and destabilize the response further.</p>

<h3>2. Basslines for Dubstep &amp; Drum and Bass</h3>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong><br />
- <strong>Wobble:</strong> Send your bass oscillator into the filter. Modulate the cutoff via the <strong>CV Direct Input</strong> with a synced LFO. Use shapes like triangle/sine for classic “wobble” (change speed for rhythm variations).
- <strong>FM Bass Growl:</strong> Run a second VCO (preferably an audio-rate one, tuned low or one octave up) into the <strong>Bi-polar FM input</strong>. Set FM depth to taste and watch the filter generate thick, growly harmonics or “talking” bass effects.
- <strong>Distortion:</strong> Engage the internal Limiter Diode and "Unstable Brite" mode for dirtier, agressive drive. Run the filter into heavy feedback with external mixing for even more chaos.
- <strong>Rhythmic Groove:</strong> Patch stepped or synced random CVs into both filter CV and FM inputs for irregular, "talking" or stuttering bassline movement.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br />
Combine 12dB LP output with the 6dB BP output, mix them externally, and pan or process them for wide/pulsating stereo bass textures.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h3>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong><br />
- <strong>Slow LFO Sweeps:</strong> Modulate the filter cutoff with a slow, irregular LFO into the <strong>CV input</strong> for evolving, organic timbres. Try mixing triangle and sample &amp; hold modulation for subtle complexity.
- <strong>Bi-polar FM for Texture:</strong> Feed a very slow LFO or audio-rate oscillator (subtle level) into the <strong>Bi-polar FM input</strong> while sending drones into the filter. This provides evolving color and movement, sometimes bordering on ringmod textures if the range is right.
- <strong>Brite Mode:</strong> Use the "Unstable Brite" mode for ghostly, slightly unpredictable resonance and artifact-laden sweeps.
- <strong>Layered Output:</strong> Use both LPF and BPF outputs, EQ and blur each differently (heavy reverb, shimmer, phasing, etc.), and layer for multi-dimensional atmospheres.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br />
If your pads are too smooth, use the limiter diode to subtly “grit up” the signal, making etheral sounds more emotionally gripping.</p>

<h3>General Modulation Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Patch filter output(s) back into input(s) (with attenuation) for self-oscillating or snarling feedback effects.</li>
<li><strong>Vary Input Levels:</strong> Using both attenuated and direct ins lets you precisely set how hard you hit the filter, greatly affecting breakup and character.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Use:</strong> Assign filter CV or FM input to pressure/aftertouch or an expression pedal for hands-on sound morphing.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Creative Patch Ideas with Vector Space</h1>
<h4>For Distorted Percussion, Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines, and Atmospheric Pads</h4>
<p>The WORNG Electronics Vector Space is an extremely powerful and flexible modulation and mixing hub for Eurorack systems. Its core purpose is to take three input signals— <strong>i, j, and k</strong>—and turn them into 17 related, but unique, CV or audio outputs via an all-analog circuit. By leveraging its <em>Cube, Plane,</em> and <em>Sphere</em> outputs, you can create a wide range of complex and evolving results. Below are practical, genre-focused techniques you can try to dial in some unique timbres and motion.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<h4><strong>Goal:</strong></h4>
<p>Create struck, glitched, or industrial percussion using Vector Space's complex output combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Concept:</strong><br />
- <strong>Inputs:</strong><br />
  - i: Snappy Envelope (or fast, sharp LFO)
  - j: Noise source or random stepped voltage
  - k: Short audio click, metallic ping, or audio-rate square wave</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Output Routing:</strong>  </li>
<li>Take <em>Plane</em> or <em>Cube</em> outs (with major LED activity) to a wavefolder, VCA, or filter set to overdrive.  </li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Plane</em> outs, in particular, will produce rectified, frequency-doubled, and phase-scrambled signals, adding metallic or digital artifact textures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extra Control:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Switch the input ranges (+/+-) to alter the baseline offset, resulting in odd clipping or biasing behavior.</li>
<li>
<p>Patch some of the Vector Space outputs back into decay/fall CV on your envelope generator for feedback-styled percussion movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Sequence your envelopes/arbitrary stepped voltages randomly for glitchy, IDM-like percussion.</li>
<li>Try ring modulating (via a VCA) the Plane out signals with other percussion elements.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<h4><strong>Goal:</strong></h4>
<p>Get those "talking," wobbly, or highly modulated basses typical in these genres.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Concept:</strong><br />
- <strong>Inputs:</strong><br />
  - i: LFO (slow to mid, e.g. 0.5–8 Hz, triangle or sine for smooth, square/saw for choppier sound)
  - j: Envelope follower from a drum track, sequencer, or another LFO with different phase/rate
  - k: Audio-rate oscillator (preferably another VCO slightly FM'ed for extra grit)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Output Routing:</strong>  </li>
<li>Use the <em>Cube</em> outs to get classic crossmodulation shapes for cutoff, sync, or waveshaping of a bass VCO or filter.</li>
<li><em>Plane</em> outs can create more aggressive, harmonically rich modulations. Patch these as CV to a wavefolder, filter cutoff, or oscillator FM input.</li>
<li>
<p>Modulate a stereo VCA or panner with a <em>Cube</em> or <em>Plane</em> output for moving/wandering basses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extra Control:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Use the Unipolar/Bipolar switches to abruptly change the modulation pattern mid-bar for growls or glitch effects.</li>
<li>
<p>Patch an output from Vector Space back to modulate the rate or depth of your primary LFOs for wilder, evolving sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Route the NegSphere out as audio to distorters, or modulate resonance for weird additional movement.</li>
<li>Try using audio-rate signals for all three inputs, and then listen to the Sphere/UnSphere outs for chaotic, wavetable-like timbres.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pad Sounds</h2>
<h4><strong>Goal:</strong></h4>
<p>Generate evolving, ethereal movement across stereo or multi-channel pad textures.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Concept:</strong><br />
- <strong>Inputs:</strong><br />
  - i: Slow LFO (sine or triangle, 0.1–0.5 Hz)
  - j: Field recording or sample playback (looped atmosphere, e.g. rain or wind)
  - k: Expression pedal/joystick, or a gentle random voltage source</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Output Routing:</strong>  </li>
<li>Send various <em>Cube</em> outs to the panning, filter, or amplitude modulation of multiple pad voices so each floats gently through the stereo field.</li>
<li>Use different <em>Plane</em> outputs to control reverb send amount, grain position, or wavetable scan position.</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Sphere</em> and <em>UnSphere</em> outs are excellent for slow, undulating modulation of overall mix parameters—global lowpass, feedback, or spatialization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extra Control:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Use the input switches to add gentle variations to the global modulations, emphasizing movement as you play.</li>
<li>
<p>If you have more than three pads, use different outs to control different sets, amplifying the “shifting cloud” effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Patch the post-effect return of one pad voice back into a Vector Space input, creating a feedback network where the texture modulates itself.</li>
<li>Tempo-sync LFOs for subtle pulse/phase effects that evolve over many bars.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Advanced Tips for All Genres</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedback Routing:</strong> Try patching one or more Vector Space outs to modulate the CV sources you’re using as inputs, leading to “recursive modulation” and highly organic sounds.</li>
<li><strong>Switch Flicking:</strong> Perform live by toggling the input polarity switches, introducing shifts, offsets, and mod mutations in your mod matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-Rate Inputs:</strong> Don’t be afraid to use audio-rate signals (even drums, samples, or chords) for FM/AM-style wildness—Vector Space processes audio just as well as CV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore, combine, and experiment—Vector Space’s strength is unlocking new forms of movement and interaction in any patch.</p>

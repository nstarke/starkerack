<h1>Creative Modulation Techniques for the Expert Sleepers ES-9</h1>
<p><em>Distorted Percussion, Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines, and Haunting Atmospheric Pads</em></p>
<p>The Expert Sleepers ES-9 isn’t just an audio interface—its advanced routing, mixing, and signal processing features make it a deep playground for transforming and modulating Eurorack signals in real time. Here’s how to creatively manipulate it for modern electronic styles:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Distorted Percussive Sounds</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Approach:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eurorack Inputs</strong>: Patch raw drum modules, noise, or struck envelopes directly into several of the 14 ES-9 inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Drive the Input</strong>: Push higher amplitude percussive CV signals (+/-10V) for digital clipping at 0dBFS, creating crunch and digital distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing &amp; EQ</strong>: In the Mixer section, combine multiple percussive elements, and use the 4-band per-channel EQ to sharply boost/cut frequencies for tone sculpting (e.g., exaggerated transient attack or metallic overtones).</li>
<li><strong>DC Coupling for CV/Modulation</strong>: Patch LFOs or envelopes into other channels, and in the config tool, turn <strong>OFF DC Blocking</strong> on input pairs to allow pure CV shapes.</li>
<li><strong>Macro &amp; Raw Mix</strong>: Set up parallel mix busses—one clean, one heavily EQ’d/distorted, and sum them at the outputs for parallel processing.</li>
<li><strong>MIDI Macro Mix Control</strong>: Perform live morphing of drum sound density using a MIDI controller to automate macro mix or pan (e.g., from snappy to obliterated).</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Extra Tip:</strong></h3>
<p>Sum several sharp envelopes in the mixer and route to the same output with massive gain/EQ boost to create digital 'clicks' and spikes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Approach:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analog Oscillator &gt; ES-9 Input</strong>: Route aggressive/sub oscillators into the ES-9. Use the optional DC coupling to bring in unfiltered CV for wild PWM or FM bass tones.</li>
<li><strong>MIDI CC Mixer Automation</strong>: Set MIDI control for mixer levels/pans. Automate with DAW or physical controls for 'wobble' effects (think LFO mapped to mixer gain/panning or quick filter enable toggles).</li>
<li><strong>Hot EQ Settings</strong>: Use Peak and Shelf EQ bands to create resonant peaks, exaggerated subs, or mid boost for growls. Try inverting the phase of one layer for “hollow” basses.</li>
<li><strong>Layer &amp; Route</strong>: With 8x8 mixer and extensive routing, layer clean and processed bass signals. Route one signal path through Mixer 1 (for clean sub) and another through Mixer 2 or the S/PDIF loop with heavy EQ or intentionally clipped gain staging.</li>
<li><strong>Dual/Linked Stereo</strong>: Use Stereo Links for wider basslines that jump across the stereo image, further modulating pan via MIDI controllers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Extra Tip:</strong></h3>
<p>Pass control-voltage derived LFO via DC-coupled input into mixer, then use that in routing as 'Amplitude Modulation' of the main bass lane, for robotic/driven tones.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Haunting Atmospheric Pads</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Approach:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer Input</strong>: Feed multiple outboard synth voices, slow LFOs, noise, and drones into multiple ES-9 inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Mixer Macro Automation</strong>: Assign MIDI faders to control mix volumes and panning, dynamically weaving pads in and out (automatable in DAW or with MIDI controller for morphing textures).</li>
<li><strong>Heavy EQ Sculpts</strong>: Apply multiple band EQs—e.g., narrow high-pass to make “whispery” tops, or strong low-pass for murk. Combine phase inversion for ghostly cancellations.</li>
<li><strong>Mix Smoothing</strong>: <strong>Turn on mix smoothing</strong> to interpolate morphs between settings, creating slow, undulating pad evolutions (<em>DSP load permitting</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Stereoizing &amp; Bussing</strong>: Use Stereo Links to create wide stereo pad movement; use the internal busses for parallel processing chains—e.g., layer a filtered pad and an unfiltered one.</li>
<li><strong>S/PDIF/Second Mixer</strong>: Use S/PDIF to send/return to outboard effects (big reverbs, shimmers), or, if running 2 mixers, set up one chain for the dry pad and another for the effected pad—blend via the ES-9.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Extra Tip:</strong></h3>
<p>Route a sidechain-modulated gate/envelope through CV inputs (with DC coupling) and use the mixer to duck pads in time with your drums for a “haunted pumping” atmosphere.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>General Power Moves</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Performance</strong>: Use the push-button knob to instantly switch between 'hosted' and 'standalone' configurations for dramatic mix/processing scene changes mid-set.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme DSP FX</strong>: Approach the 100% DSP limit by stacking filters and smoothing for digital mutants and over-processed oddities.</li>
<li><strong>DAW+Modular Interplay</strong>: With simultaneous DAW routing and modulation, treat the ES-9 as a hybrid programmable-effects-and-mixing brain.</li>
</ul>

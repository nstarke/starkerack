<h1>Creative Modulation with Terci Ruina (Noise Engineering)</h1>
<p><em>For Distorted Percussion, Dubsteppy Basslines, and Haunting Pads</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Terci Ruina</strong> is a triple-distortion 4HP Eurorack module, offering three distinct analog distortion circuits (FB, FF, FZ) in series or standalone, with a distinctly raw and chaotic character. Exploiting its modular patching and modulation potential can create wild, genre-pushing textures. Here’s how to get the most out of it for your sound design goals:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Creating Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<h3>Key Approaches:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insert After a Percussion Source:</strong> Route drum modules (analog or digital, e.g. BIA or samples) directly into the input of Terci Ruina.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Input/Output Normalization:</strong> By patching in and out between individual stages (FB, FF, FZ), you can reorder or isolate distortions for unique flavors.</li>
<li><strong>CV Modulation:</strong> Terci Ruina does not offer CV control over its distortion levels by default. To achieve dynamic, animated timbres:<ul>
<li><strong>Use a VCA (pre-TR):</strong> Modulate input amplitude with an envelope or LFO for amplitude-dependent distortion character.</li>
<li><strong>Place VCA (post-TR):</strong> Use a short, snappy envelope to tame tails and create punchy, gated distortion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rhythmic Sidechaining:</strong> If you want the distortion to "pump" in time with your drums, route the output through a VCA modulated by another track’s envelope/LFO.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Filtering:</strong> Pre- or post-filtering shapes which frequencies get distorted or amplified. E.g. a LPF before Terci Ruina means only low end gets heavy distortion—great for throbbing kicks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patch Example:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Drum oscillator (e.g., BIA or analog kick/snare) → [VCA] (modulated by percussion envelope) → Terci Ruina IN 1</li>
<li>OUT 3 → [VCA or Env Follower] → Mixer</li>
<li>(Optional) Use output of OUT 1, 2, or 3 direct to mixer for parallel processing or layering.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>2. Designing Aggressive Basslines (Dubstep, DnB)</h2>
<h3>Key Approaches:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distortion Stage Reordering:</strong> Try routing through individual IN/OUTs to change saturation color (e.g., start with FZ fuzz, then FB, then FF). Each order yields different harmonics.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Shaping:</strong> For dubstep wobble, send your bass voice through a filter with an envelope/LFO modulating cutoff and/or resonance, then into Terci Ruina.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Performance:</strong> Twist the TR knobs live to create evolving, expressive distortion sweeps. For more control, patch an external voltage-controlled attenuator (like an external VCA) in series.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Bass:</strong> Blend clean and processed signals. Use a mixer to recombine for clarity with aggression.</li>
<li><strong>Resonant Filtering:</strong> Insert resonant LP or BP filter pre- or post-TR, modulated by fast LFO or envelope, for talking/wah timbres.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patch Example:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bass oscillator (complex, wavetable, or saw) → [Filter, cutoff modulated by LFO/env] → Terci Ruina (try inputting into FZ or reordering stages)</li>
<li>OUT 3 → [VCA, envelope-controlled] → Sub-mixer</li>
<li>Clean signal parallel to processed signal for added punch.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>3. Building Atmospheric, Haunting Pads</h2>
<h3>Key Approaches:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gentle/Glitchy Distortion:</strong> Lower input gain into Terci Ruina, just barely hitting clipping. This keeps it textural, not overblown.</li>
<li><strong>Modulating Input Dynamics:</strong> Subtle modulation of input level with slow, looping envelopes to animate distortion movement over held pads.</li>
<li><strong>Post-TR Effects:</strong> Combine with reverb &amp; delay after Terci Ruina for vast, eerie space. Ring mod or granular processing can add further complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Filtering:</strong> Place VCF after TR, modulate cutoff with a very slow LFO for an evolving, spectral effect.</li>
<li><strong>Multistage Patching:</strong> Parallel process different voices through different TR sections, recombine, pan, and effect separately for width and movement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patch Example:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Polyphonic pad voice (audio interface or oscillator cluster) → VCA (modulated by slow attack envelope or LFO) → Terci Ruina IN 1 or 2</li>
<li>OUT 3 → Stereo reverb → Delay → Filter (modulated by LFO or random CV) → Mixer</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Pro Tips:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order Matters:</strong> Try different ordering of the distortions by patching IN/OUT individually; FB → FF → FZ, or try FZ → FB → FF, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> After extreme distortion, put a VCA or gate (Sinclastic Empulatrix, Sinc Bucina) at the end of chain to control excessive noise or feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Live Play:</strong> Even without CV, manual knob tweaks during live performance can yield dynamic, morphing character.</li>
</ul>

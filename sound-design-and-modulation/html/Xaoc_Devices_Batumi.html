<h1>Creative Modulation Techniques for Batumi II (+Poti II)</h1>
<p><em>Aimed at distorted percussive sounds, basslines (d&amp;b/dubstep), and atmospheric pads</em></p>
<p><strong>Batumi II</strong> is one of the deepest Eurorack LFO/VCOs, and with the <strong>Poti II</strong> expander you get extensive hands-on and CV modulation options per channel. Here’s how you can squeeze some unique and extreme sounds from them, based on the manual:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<h3>Extreme Phase Modulation (Pseudo-FM Synthesis)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> Set Batumi II to <strong>Phase Mode</strong> (yellow LED). Use one channel at audio rate (using slider + CV as VCO), then patch another channel's output into the first channel’s <strong>FRQ/PH/RTO CV input</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> This creates brutal FM-style timbres, perfect for metallic/harsh percussive hits. Modulating phase rapidly can morph sine waves into sharp, distorted clangs. If you have a VCA, use it to rhythmically gate the output for further percussive effect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hard Reset Sync for Glitchy Hits</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> Feed rhythmic triggers (from sequencer or burst generator) into Batumi’s <strong>RESET/SYNC inputs</strong> in Reset Mode (LED off).</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> This hard-resets the phase, chopping or stuttering the LFO/VCO—perfect for digitally-glitchy clicks, folds, or repeating percussive blips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wavefolding Percussion with Poti II</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> On the <strong>Poti II</strong>, select “Sine Out” for the target channel. Feed audio-rate CV into the corresponding <strong>SHAPE input</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> The sine wave will be wavefolded and amplified dynamically (with auto-amplitude compensation), generating harsh, clangorous, or almost metallic percussion like you might hear in more aggressive modular techno or glitch.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basses</h2>
<h3>Audio-rate LFO as VCO with V/Oct Tracking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> Use any channel in <strong>Free Mode</strong> as a VCO, patch sequenced CV (from keyboard/sequencer) into the channel’s CV input—Batumi tracks 1V/oct pretty well.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> You get classic sub bass, but with available complex waves (triangle, trapezoid, etc.), and random/smooth random for more experimental tones.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bass Wobble via Wave Morph + Phase Sync</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> Assign “asgn” output (triangle, saw, random, etc.) per channel with Poti II. Modulate wave shape by sending LFO or envelope into its <strong>SHAPE input</strong> (switch set to “asgn”).</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Morphing between waves can make LFOs that “wobble” the timbre of your bass, giving you those famous dubstep modulated basslines—especially when passed through a filter or distortion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Suboscillator Trick: Divide Mode</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> In <strong>Divide Mode</strong> (blue LED), b/c/d channels become divisions of channel a. Set a to audio rate, others to 1, 2, 4, etc.—run trigs into reset/sync for phase variations.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Create a stack of related suboscillators at subharmonic intervals, dialing in classic reese or layered d&amp;b basses by mixing waves.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Pads &amp; Atmospheric Sounds</h2>
<h3>Multi-channel Random LFOs for Modulation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> In <strong>Free Mode</strong>, set b/c/d channels to stepped or smooth random via wave select. Patch their outputs into filter cutoff, VCA CV, reverb, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Non-repeating, uncorrelated modulation lets pads drift, swell, and evolve organically—especially when each channel modulates a different effect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synchronous Morphing Pads in Phase/Divide/Mult Mode</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> In <strong>Phase</strong>/<strong>Divide</strong>/<strong>Mult</strong> modes, all channels sync to channel a; set the others' sliders for phase/frequency offsets. Set each asgn output to a different waveform (using Poti II).</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Generate four perfectly interlocked LFOs or VCOs, with each morphing/wobbling its own parameter, for shimmering, spectral pad atmospheres.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modulating Wave Shape for Subtle Complexity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How:</strong> Use <strong>Poti II SHAPE input</strong> CVs to slowly morph sine to folded or asgn output’s shape; especially on random and trapezoid shapes.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Pads that "breathe" and shimmer as overtones and timbre shift smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>VCAs after Batumi II:</strong> Process its output with VCAs/envelopes for "pluck" or "hit" envelopes.</li>
<li><strong>Cascading Reset:</strong> Patch Batumi II’s outputs into its own or another channel’s reset input for recursive, chaotic modulation.</li>
<li><strong>Clock-following LFOs:</strong> Use sync mode to lock Batumi II to external clocks for tempo-synced modulations (great for rhythmic pads and syncopated bounces).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patching Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Percussion:</strong> Batumi Sine Out → Wavefolded by SHAPE input → VCA (triggered by sequencer) → Distortion/FX.</li>
<li><strong>Dubstep Bass:</strong> Batumi Channel a in audio rate, modulated by Batumi Channel b LFO in phase mode, with asgn set to triangle, routed through filter and distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Atmospheric Pad:</strong> Multiple Batumi channels in random mode, each modulating different effect/parameter (reverb wet, filter cutoff, VCA gain, delay time).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Creative Modulation Ideas Using the 2hp 3:1 Eurorack Module</h1>
<p>The <strong>2hp 3:1</strong> is a voltage-controlled gate switch/summer that can route or sum three gate/trigger inputs under manual or CV control. This module is a flexible tool for intricate patching strategies in both rhythmic and melodic contexts. Here are detailed ideas for using this module to sculpt <strong>distorted percussion, wild basslines, and eerie pads</strong> as heard in genres like dubstep, drum and bass, and dark ambient.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Core Modulation Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voltage Control over Input Selection:</strong> Route rhythmic gates/sequences with hands-free CV.</li>
<li><strong>Selective/Summing Modes:</strong> Either isolate a single input or combine multiple gate streams for polyrhythmic complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Gate-to-Trigger Conversion:</strong> Great for precision-triggering complex envelopes or percussive events.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Drive drums or metallic hits with sharp, unpredictable gates to create "glitchy" or "broken" percussion.</p>
<h3>Patch Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhythmic Chaos:</strong></li>
<li>Patch three different rhythmic gate sources (e.g., clock dividers, random triggers, or Euclidean patterns) into IN 1, IN 2, and IN 3.</li>
<li>Toggle to <strong>SUM mode</strong> (mode right). All simultaneous gate inputs will be summed to short triggers (5ms), rapidly retriggering downstream modules—perfect for noisy, layered percussion.</li>
<li><strong>External Modulation:</strong></li>
<li>Send a stepped random CV (e.g., from a sample and hold) or a lively LFO into SEL CV to automate and “fracture” gate selection on the fly, making percussion stutter and shift.</li>
<li>Route OUT to a distortion/wavefolder and then to a drum sound generator for harsh, digital artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quick Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>velocity-sensitive envelopes</strong> triggered from 3:1 OUT to sculpt transients.</li>
<li>For digital grit, clock an audio-rate square oscillator as a trigger source for metallic “clangs”.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Aggressive/Crazy Basslines (Dubstep, DnB)</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create switching basslines with gnarly rhythm and timbral switchups.</p>
<h3>Patch Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bassline Articulation:</strong></li>
<li>Patch gates from different bass step sequencer lines (even if programmed out of phase) to the three INs.</li>
<li>Use a sequencer or envelope follower from your drum hits to modulate SEL CV, allowing bass notes to “switch pattern” as the drums play—classic "talking" or "bouncing" dubstep effect.</li>
<li>OUT feeds an envelope or direct VCA controlling a bass oscillator or filter ping for <em>precisely-timed growls</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Malfunctioning Wobble:</strong></li>
<li>In SUM mode, overlapping bass rhythm gates trigger retriggers—try sending this summed/triggered signal to a waveshaper for unpredictable, “broken voice” bass contours.</li>
<li><strong>CV Trick:</strong></li>
<li>Use a quadrature LFO on SEL CV for cyclical, morphing riffs; fast LFO rates can “granulize” gates for bass stutters.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Evolve sustained pads by creatively gating multiple modulators or textures.</p>
<h3>Patch Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Texture Weaving:</strong></li>
<li>Gate three “layers” of slow-moving modulation sources (random LFOs, envelopes, or drone oscillators) into IN 1–3, mix through SUM mode.</li>
<li>CV automate SEL with slowly drifting random voltages; this will fade layers in/out, making pads shift unpredictably.</li>
<li>OUT triggers VCA or CV inputs on reverbs/FX for ambient “echoes” that flicker in and out of existence.</li>
<li><strong>Ghostly Pulses:</strong></li>
<li>Use sporadic trigger patterns from a random rhythm generator; output governs when certain pad layers or FX chains are active, creating ethereal movement.</li>
<li><strong>Pad Animation:</strong></li>
<li>Gated triggers from 3:1 OUT can start envelope generators for filter sweeps or wavetable morphs—make atmospheric pads “breathe” and mutter with every switching event.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Extra Patch Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Treat the SEL control as a major timbre animator; slowly morph selection for morphing, fast for glitch.</li>
<li><strong>Abusing Modes:</strong> Toggle SELECT and SUM mode with clock/reset edges for extreme, performance-oriented scene changes.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual FX:</strong> The 5ms gate-to-trigger in SUM mode lets you precisely ping LPGs (Low Pass Gates) or make short, plucky FM percussion.</li>
</ul>

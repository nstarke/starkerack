<h1>Creative Sound Design With Frequency Central Wonderland</h1>
<p>As a fellow Eurorack musician, I’ve taken a close look at the Wonderland module’s documentation and here’s how you can use (and abuse) this powerful 8x8 patchbay/matrix mixer for sound design—especially for aggressive percussion, heavy basslines, and atmospheric pads typical of dubstep, drum and bass, and cinematic genres.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Core Capabilities Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>8 inputs</strong> (<em>each with a micro-attenuator</em>)</li>
<li><strong>8 normal outputs</strong> + <strong>8 inverted outputs</strong> (<em>180° out of phase</em>)</li>
<li><strong>64 pushbutton switch matrix:</strong> freely route any combo of inputs to any outputs, with possible mults, sums, and inversions</li>
<li><strong>Miniature input attenuators:</strong> support gain staging and deliberate distortion</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Technique:</strong><br />
Leverage matrix mixing to <em>stack multiple percussive sources to a single output</em>, creating intentional clipping/distortion via the summed signal level. Use normal and inverted outputs to reinforce or cancel elements, and micro-attenuators to fine-tune distortion character.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connect several drum modules or short, snappy synth blips to multiple Wonderland inputs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Route them to one output via multiple engaged switches (e.g., Inputs 1, 3, 5 → Output A).</strong><ul>
<li>Turn the attenuators higher to intentionally overload/clipping the output—Audible distortion = edgy percussion!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Take inverted outputs to a separate VCA, then mix with normal outputs for dynamic phase-cancelled “rip” effects.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For extra grit:</strong> Take the distorted output and send it into a wavefolder/waveshaper, or back into your modular FX chain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br />
<em>Don’t forget to experiment with routing and blending outputs back into other inputs for quick, no-cable feedback paths!</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Crazy, Modulated Basslines (Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Style)</h2>
<p><strong>Technique:</strong><br />
Achieve wild, modulated bass by combining several different oscillators/waveforms (e.g. sine + saw + noise) into a single output. Use inverted and normal outputs simultaneously for stereo or mid/side tricks, or route one signal to both normal and inverted outputs for “hollow,” toothy sounds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Sub-oscillator, main bass osc, and noise source to different Wonderland inputs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Send all three to one output for a thick, layered signal.</strong><ul>
<li>Add envelope or LFO-modulated attenuation using the Wonderland’s micro-attenuators for dynamic movement. (Or modulate attenuators externally by carefully wiggling or swapping voltage sources if hardware allows.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Patch inverted output to a filter or VCA, then crossfade/mix with the normal output for evolving phase changes—a trick for morphing bass timbres.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mult the output into other processors (bitcrusher, distortion), then re-sum back into Wonderland along with dry signal for parallel processing within the mixer.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br />
<em>Use Wonderland as a switch matrix live: tap in or out different waves/noises with the pushbuttons for “instant drop” effects and ever-changing bass tone.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting, Atmospheric Pad Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Technique:</strong><br />
Create evolving textures by routing multiple slow, droning sound sources with lots of modulation (e.g. LFOs, slow envelopes, random voltage) through the matrix. Sum and cross-phase the outputs, and experiment with attenuator positions for subtle movement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Send several subtle, evolving sound sources (FM drones, field recordings, reverb returns) to Inputs 2, 4, 6, and 8.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assign each to a range of outputs, spreading textures across the matrix.</strong><ul>
<li>Engage both normal and inverted outputs—pan one left, pan the other right for <em>supernatural stereo width</em> by mixing in and out of phase signals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Use the micro-attenuators to set just the right blend—low/no distortion, but rich sum textures.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patch returns from modulation or FX processors (tape delay, granular) into more matrix inputs for feedback atmospheric layering.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Swap patch button combos during a performance for ghostly, morphing landscapes.</strong><ul>
<li>Disengage certain buttons suddenly to “hollow out” the pad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong><br />
<em>Automate (by hand) the switching matrix during performance for polyrhythmic, ghostly rhythmic movement in pads and drones.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Advanced Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedback Chaos:</strong> Route an output back to a free input for internal feedback loops—start with the micro-attenuators low and introduce drone or shrieking FX as you slowly raise attenuation.</li>
<li><strong>CV Processing:</strong> Although designed for audio, Wonderland could process CV, letting you combine or invert modulation sources for evolving filter/oscillator control.</li>
<li><strong>Live Remixing:</strong> Use pushbuttons to “remix” your input sources live—instantly jump between percussion, bass, and pad-focused textures.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Modulating Vhikk X for Eurorack: Sound Design Guide</h1>
<p><em>(Focus: Distorted Percussion, Dubstep/DnB Basses, Haunting Pads)</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Vhikk X</strong> by Forge TME is a multi-algorithm stereo sound source and processor designed for hands-on exploration in modular synth setups. It offers 36 algorithms (9 per bank, 4 banks), extensive CV modulation, and stereo in/out for both creation and processing of wild, dense, or delicate sounds.</p>
<p>Below are recommended patching and modulation strategies tailored for <strong>distorted percussion, crazy basslines, and haunting atmospheric pads</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Key CV Inputs &amp; Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MORPH, BASIS, FIELD, TIME, FORM</strong> (CV with attenuverters): Modulate these for dynamic timbral shifts.</li>
<li><strong>VCA</strong>: Internal stereo VCA; CV control for amplitude/punch shaping.</li>
<li><strong>SEED, SCAN</strong> (Encoders, no CV): Manual/automation for algorithmic randomness &amp; morphing.</li>
<li><strong>Volume in/out</strong>: Can be overdriven for distortion.</li>
<li><strong>Two Toggles</strong>: Algorithm selection.</li>
<li><strong>Four Banks</strong>: More options with future updates/firmware.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CV Routing Tips:</strong>
- Any CV in VCA is normalled to all other param CVs (if unpatched).
- MORPH CV normalled to remaining param CVs (if unpatched).
- Attenuverters = on-the-panel fine-tuning.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong>
- Choose an algorithm with sharp transients, granulation, or aggressive processing (experiment with different toggle/bank combos).
- Feed short triggers, envelopes, or audio percussion samples into the stereo inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Modulation Moves:</strong>
- Patch fast, snappy envelopes (from Maths, Quadrax, etc.) into the <strong>VCA CV</strong> for sharply gated, drum-like attacks.
- Modulate <strong>MORPH</strong> and <strong>BASIS</strong> with stepped/random voltages or fast LFOs — jump between different timbres, glitchy distortion, and pitch bursts.
- Drive the <strong>Input Gain</strong> and <strong>Output Gain</strong> using the encoders to add internal clipping/distortion (Vhikk X soft-clips at each gain stage for punchy grit).
- Patch a slow LFO into <strong>FIELD</strong> to create movement within the percussive shell, morphing the overtones or decay characteristics per hit.
- Use the <strong>TIME</strong> CV to vary granulation or internal delay/reverb times, for metallic, ringing, or decaying echoes.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Extreme:</strong> Randomize <strong>SEED/SCAN</strong> via manual press (both buttons), causing algorithmic chaos between hits.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Dubstep/Neuro Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong>
- Select an algorithm that's synth-heavy—complex oscillators, wavefolders, or aggressive filters.</p>
<p><strong>Modulation Moves:</strong>
- Use a quantized pitch sequence into <strong>BASIS</strong> (V/Oct calibrated) for note control.
- Route an audio-rate LFO or oscillator to <strong>MORPH</strong> or <strong>FORM</strong> for FM-style, gnarly transformer bass movement.
- Patch a sync'ed envelope or stepped random into <strong>TIME</strong>, <strong>FIELD</strong>, and <strong>VCA</strong> for 'wobble'—tight amplitude shaping, filter sweeps, and formant morphing.
- Push the <strong>Input</strong> and <strong>Output Gain</strong> encoders into saturation for crunchy, heavy distortion.
- Manually 'scan' with the <strong>SCAN</strong> encoder during a sequence to morph bass 'characters' in real time.
- Use stereo outputs to widen the bass via external mid-side, chorus, or direct patching for a massive effect.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Extreme:</strong> Launch into extreme modulation depths, overdriving CV attenuverters for unpredictable, unstable timbres. Try flipping algorithms mid-bar ("toggle switch performance") for glitchy, aggressive phrases.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. Haunting Atmospheric Pad Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong>
- Pick an algorithm focused on granular, shimmering, or filter-resonant sounds—often in true stereo.</p>
<p><strong>Modulation Moves:</strong>
- Feed slow, looping envelopes or random LFOs into <strong>MORPH, FIELD, FORM, TIME</strong> for continuous drifting soundscapes.
- Use low amplitude/no CV in <strong>VCA</strong> for swelling, evolving pads.
- Patch stereo field recordings, synth chords, or noise into <strong>Stereo Inputs</strong>; process these with Vhikk X's reverb, delay, or spectral algorithms.
- Keep the <strong>Input/Output Gains</strong> moderate for headroom; overdrive only for distant, haunted saturation.
- Slowly rotate <strong>SEED</strong> and <strong>SCAN</strong> encoders to drastically evolve algorithms, introducing spectral artifacts and spectral haloes.
- Automate switching through banks/algorithms for scene changes without patch rewiring.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Extreme:</strong> Use the <strong>internal randomisation (press both buttons)</strong> to inject spontaneous ghostly mutations.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Power User Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attenuverters as Manual Shapers:</strong> When no CV is patched, these become precise manual 'morphers'—glide through sound worlds by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Global vs. Per-Algorithm Save:</strong> Store 'scene' settings for rapid recall—use per-algorithm storage for live sets/performance flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Calibration:</strong> Ensure BASIS is calibrated for perfect 1V/oct tracking if playing melodies/basses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Example Patching Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Distorted Snare:</strong>
- Envelope → VCA
- Fast S&amp;H → TIME, MORPH
- Hot Input Signal + High Output Gain = Hard Digital Clipping
- Tap both buttons for SEED-ful chaos</p>
<p><strong>Wobble Bass:</strong>
- Sequencer → BASIS (V/Oct)
- Audio-rate Osc → FORM
- S&amp;H or Sequenced Envelope → FIELD, TIME
- MOD Wheel → MORPH (performance filter sweeps)
- Slow SCAN encoder movement for evolution</p>
<p><strong>Haunted Pad:</strong>
- Stereo Input (tape hiss/field) → Inputs
- Two slow LFOs → FORM, FIELD
- Envelope → VCA for slow fade ins/outs
- Periodic manual SEED/SCAN movements or internal randomization</p>

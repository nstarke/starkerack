<h1>Modulation &amp; Creative Patching with the Pittsburgh Modular <strong>Game System</strong></h1>
<p>The Pittsburgh Modular Game System is an innovative and deep multi-sequencer module for eurorack, featuring six "game modes" that excel at both traditional and experimental sequencing. With its <strong>joystick, buttons</strong>, and <strong>fully voltage-controllable interface</strong>, the Game System stands out for external modulation. The following are some patching and modulation ideas targeting <strong>distorted percussion</strong>, <strong>aggressive basslines</strong>, and <strong>atmospheric pads</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. General Patch Ideas for Modulation</h2>
<h3>Voltage Control Possibilities</h3>
<p>Every Game/CV control (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, BUTTON, MODE, RESET, CLOCK) can be triggered or modulated via CV/gate input. This makes it perfect for <strong>CV/Gate automation</strong>, LFOs, random sources, or triggers to push the sequencer in unexpected directions.</p>
<h3>Joystick/Step Modulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a chaotic LFO or stepped random (e.g., <em>Wogglebug</em>, <em>Pam’s New Workout</em>, <em>Turing Machine</em>) patched to the UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT CV inputs to automatically navigate the Game System’s matrix/steps.</li>
<li>Envelope generators or rhythmic gates can "press" BUTTON or MODE, toggling modes or filling in steps—great for <em>live algorithmic changes</em>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Distorted Percussive Sounds</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Best "Game": DRUM SEQUENCER (GAME 3)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Tips:</strong></li>
<li>Patch the Drum Sequencer gates (Outputs 1-4) to a variety of percussion voices (classic drum modules, analog noise sources, or even envelopes keying VCAs).</li>
<li>Mult or stack the <em>same</em> gate output to trigger several modules for layered percussion.</li>
<li>Send your percussion voices through wavefolders, saturation, or distortion modules for aggressive, industrial tones.</li>
<li>Modulate the <strong>joystick/cursor position</strong> via <em>random</em> or <em>clocked stepped</em> CV to create erratic, glitchy fills—like random drum rolls or unexpected accent patterns.</li>
<li>Use MODE input (CV) to automate flipping green/red sequencers for dynamic, evolving rhythm structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supercharged Patches:</strong>
- <strong>Patch a CV sequencer or stepped random voltage into UP/DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT to make the Drum Sequencer continuously select different steps (auto-drum fill generator!).</strong>
- Mult a <em>noisy</em> gate output to both a drum voice and a distortion/wavefolder’s CV input for interactive overdrive.
- Run a clock divider into RESET or MODE for shifting groove accents and live muting.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Crazy Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Best "Games": MUSIC SEQUENCER (GAME 2), PROBABILITY MACHINE (GAME 5), EUCLIDEAN RHYTHMS (GAME 6)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Tips:</strong></li>
<li>Music Sequencer: Sequence 32 steps of 1V/oct bass (with slew on the output, if desired, for slides/portamento). Outputs are quantized for precise tuning. Patch through LPG with envelope for punch.</li>
<li>For movement, automate joystick left/right (step select) and up/down (pitch) with a slow or chaotic CV—basslines evolve in real-time!</li>
<li>Hold Joystick Button for "last step" resets to create <em>odd-length sequences</em> and polyrhythms, perfect for D&amp;B.</li>
<li>Use Probability Machine: Patch gate outputs to bass voice envelopes. CV outs can FM or modulate bass harmonics for unexpected timbral variety.</li>
<li>In Euclidean mode: Automate sequence length/beats via LFOs or random CV for shifting, skittering syncopated bass.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supercharged Patches:</strong>
- Sync the Game System clock to your master clock for tight grooves, then modulate the clock division via CV for drop/build effects.
- Clock-sync CV LFO into the BUTTON input and random source into RIGHT/LEFT for evolving steps.
- Use the Probability Machine’s paired CV/gates for bass voice cutoff and amplitude—randomized snarling movement.
- Patch a gate out to flip a waveshaper or distortion's mode in sync with bass pattern hits.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>Haunting Atmospheric Pads</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Best "Games": MUSIC SEQUENCER, EUCLIDEAN RHYTHMS, TIME TRAVELLER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Tips:</strong></li>
<li>Use CV outs for slow-moving pitch or filter number sequences on dual/four-voice oscillators with long envelope releases.</li>
<li>Use external LFO or random source into UP/DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT for generative cursor motion—notes or chord changes all drift unpredictably.</li>
<li>In Time Traveller mode, send random or slow periodic voltages into joystick CVs for shifting polyrhythmic clocks that gate VCAs, filters, or reverb processors.</li>
<li>Euclidean mode: Program lush, polyphonic sustained chords or pulses, modulate beat count for evolving textures.</li>
<li>Use RESET or MODE button CV for sudden, ghostly pattern morphs.</li>
<li>Run CV and gate outs through delay and reverb for deep space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supercharged Patches:</strong>
- Mult the same CV output across several detuned oscillators for thickening.
- Use the Game System’s random CV sources (like Meteor Shower or Probability Machine) as slow modulator signals for <em>ambient washes</em>.
- Slowly randomize clock speed or division via CV for warbling effect.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Combining CV Inputs for Maximum Modulation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chain your control sources: Set up a sequential switch or logic module feeding random, LFO, and envelope signals to the Game System’s control inputs. This gives <em>real-time or automated variation</em> across all game modes.</li>
<li>Stack clock divisions, clock multipliers, and logic signals to the CLOCK input for complex, non-repetitive rhythmic foundations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Patch Chain for Chaotic Bass-Drum Combo:</strong>
- Use Probability Machine in <em>crazy</em> mode for main bassline pitch sequence (CV out), clocked at double-time.
- Drum Sequencer triggers main drums—MODULATE its cursor via a triggered random CV, driven in sync with Probability Machine gates for reactive percussion.
- Patch gate outs to trigger distortions and amplitude/fold parameters for <em>bass growls</em>.</p>

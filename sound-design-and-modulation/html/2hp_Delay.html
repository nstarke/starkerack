<h1>Creative Modulation with 2hp Delay: Unique Sound Design</h1>
<p>The 2hp Delay module is a compact, CV-controllable digital delay suited for everything from crispy percussive effects to deep, warping pads. Here are high-impact modulation strategies for <strong>distorted percussion</strong>, <strong>dubstep/drum &amp; bass basslines</strong>, and <strong>haunting pads</strong>:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Modulations:</strong> FDBK CV, TIME CV  </li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong>  </li>
<li><em>Patch drums or short percussive sounds</em> (e.g., from a drum module or synth voice) into the <strong>IN</strong>.</li>
<li>Set <strong>TIME</strong> low (short delay times = slapback) for glitchy artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Modulate TIME CV</strong> from a fast envelope or trigger sequencer, making each hit shift in delay time—this introduces accents, pitch artifacts, and off-kilter pulses.</li>
<li><strong>Increase FDBK</strong>, perhaps modulated with random stepped CV (Sample &amp; Hold, random gates, or even audio-rate CV) to push the repeats into self-oscillation for overdriven, crushed sound.</li>
<li><strong>Option:</strong> Overdrive by pushing the <strong>FDBK</strong> knob to maximum, allowing chaotic feedback loops—a classic distorted, noisy percussion trick.</li>
<li><strong>Mix</strong>: Use MIX CV to dynamically blend dry/wet sound with accent envelopes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Modulations:</strong> TIME CV, FDBK CV, MIX CV</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong></li>
<li><em>Patch bass synth voice</em> to <strong>IN</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>LFOs or Envelopes</strong> to modulate <strong>TIME CV</strong> between 0V and 5V on the beat. Extreme modulation can cause pitch-smearing and aggressive time-stretched bass movement typical in Neuro, brostep, or techstep.</li>
<li>Set <strong>FDBK</strong> high and modulate with another LFO or envelope—increasing feedback during drops and breakdowns for growling, resonant tails.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-rate modulation</strong> to TIME CV or FDBK CV (patch fast LFO or even oscillator) can create FM-like distortion and unexpected bass artifacts.</li>
<li>Automate <strong>MIX CV</strong> with sequencer or envelope—bring the delay in and out with quick movements for dramatic, rhythmic variation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Modulations:</strong> TIME CV, FDBK CV, MIX CV</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong></li>
<li><em>Patch drones, chords, or evolving pads</em> to <strong>IN</strong>.</li>
<li>Set <strong>TIME</strong> to longer settings (fully clockwise) for almost 2 seconds of repetition.</li>
<li>Use slow, subtle LFO or random voltage to <strong>modulate TIME CV</strong>—this creates gentle pitch modulation and evolving, ghostly motion as repeats smear and shift.</li>
<li>Push <strong>FDBK</strong> close to maximum (just before infinite self-oscillation) and gently modulate with slow envelopes/random CV for shimmering echoes and swelling noise layers.</li>
<li>Set <strong>MIX</strong> to about 50/50 and automate with slow envelopes or a joystick to pan between dry and wet, moving through blurry, mysterious spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Patch the OUT back into FX or another delay for deep, atmospheric layering.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Additional Patch Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>CV inputs are all added to the knob positions (0–5V), so hands-on tweaks plus automation can be combined.</li>
<li>Use end-of-cycle triggers or rhythm clocks to periodically drive extreme FDBK or TIME jumps for automated fills/breaks.</li>
<li>Clocked stepped random (Sample &amp; Hold) into TIME or FDBK CV makes granular, evolving effects.</li>
</ul>

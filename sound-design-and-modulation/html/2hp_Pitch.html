<h1>Creative Modulation Tips for 2hp Pitch</h1>
<p><em><strong>For Distorted Percussion, Aggressive Basslines, and Haunting Pads</strong></em></p>
<p>The 2hp Pitch is a compact, time-domain pitch shifter with voltage-controllable wow &amp; flutter, designed for highly musical or deeply experimental results. Let’s break down ways to patch and modulate this module into the realms you described.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Modulation Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>W&amp;F CV Input</strong> – Modulates the wow and flutter effect; adds pitch warble similar to tape or vinyl irregularities.</li>
<li><strong>Mix CV Input</strong> – Controls the blend between dry (original) and wet (processed/pitch-shifted) signals.</li>
<li><strong>1V/OCT Input</strong> – Accepts pitch voltages for melodic or atonal pitch shifting, tracks an extra octave over the front knob.</li>
<li><strong>Pitch Knobs</strong> – Manual pitch shifting up to ±2 octaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>All are voltage-controllable, so CV, LFOs, gates, envelopes, or sequencers can be used for dynamic manipulation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Distorted Percussive Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Patch Idea</strong>
1. Patch a short percussive audio source (kick, snare, plucky synth, noise burst) into <strong>Audio Input</strong>.
2. Send trigger or gate envelopes into the <strong>1V/OCT</strong> to modulate pitch shift with each hit, creating “pitched percussion” or glitchy artifacts.
3. Use the <strong>W&amp;F CV Input</strong> with a fast, random stepped CV (like a sample and hold or fast random LFO) to cause unpredictable pitch flutter, mimicking tape or digital artifacting.
4. Set <strong>Mix</strong> to 100% wet for fully processed sound, or modulate <strong>Mix</strong> with an LFO/envelope to create motion—e.g., punch a hit then fade to dry.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Tip:</strong><br />
Turn W&amp;F fully CW for maximum instability, then send sharp CV bursts to W&amp;F CV to add “tape break” drama to your percussive hits.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Crazy Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Basslines</h2>
<p><strong>Patch Idea</strong>
1. Feed a rich oscillator or FM bass patch into <strong>Audio Input</strong>.
2. Sequence the <strong>1V/OCT</strong> with a pitch CV line running at 1/16th or 1/32nd notes for stepped, “talking” bass modulation.
3. Modulate <strong>W&amp;F</strong> with a synced LFO or a tempo-synced stepped random, creating rhythmic vibrato or “robot malfunction” wobbles.
4. Use an envelope or LFO to sweep the <strong>Mix</strong>, so the bassline moves from “normal” to warped during drops or fills.
5. Push <strong>Pitch Knob</strong> away from center while modulating with <strong>1V/OCT</strong> for subharmonic or overtone madness.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Tip:</strong><br />
Try audio-rate modulation into <strong>W&amp;F CV Input</strong> for digital aliasing and gnarly artifacts—great for aggressive, distorted bass textures.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Haunting Atmospheric Pad Sounds</h2>
<p><strong>Patch Idea</strong>
1. Patch a slow-evolving pad or drone as <strong>Audio Input</strong>.
2. Use a slow triangle or sine LFO into <strong>1V/OCT</strong> to create gentle, gradual detuning or chorusing.
3. Patch a very slow, slewed random CV or fluctuating stepped source (like Wogglebug, Turing Machine, or noise &amp; slew) into <strong>W&amp;F CV Input</strong> for lush, unpredictable tape warble, giving the sound a ghostly, old-record vibe.
4. Keep <strong>Mix</strong> ~70% wet to retain some solidity but with an ethereal tail.
5. Slightly offset the <strong>Pitch Knob</strong> for ever-present otherworldliness.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Tip:</strong><br />
If you have a second LFO, modulate <strong>Mix</strong> slowly and asynchronously with the above, gently fading the haunting effect in and out for evolving, cinematic richness.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Bonus: Combination Effects</h2>
<p><strong>Freeze + Pitch:</strong><br />
Pair the 2hp Pitch with a granular or freeze module for ultimate lo-fi unpredictability. Send modulated, pitch-shifted sounds into a buffer/freeze effect, then further pitch shift for haunted digital echoes or dystopian fragments.</p>
<p><strong>Layering:</strong><br />
Split your source: send the dry and pitch-shifted outputs into two channels of your mixer. Treat each channel separately (independent FX, panning, further processing) for wide, stereo-warped soundscapes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Technical Patching Reminders</h2>
<ul>
<li>CV ranges are ±5V. Ensure your modulation sources match this for maximum effect.</li>
<li>Keep power consumption modest: +12V: 78mA, -12V: 9mA—easily fits most small skiffs.</li>
<li>Monitor headroom: pitch shifting can sometimes introduce level changes or phase artifacts.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Creative Modulation Techniques for 2hp Swarm</h1>
<p><em>(Focusing on Distorted Percussive Sounds, Aggressive Basslines, and Atmospheric Pads)</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The <strong>2hp Swarm</strong> is a compact but highly-featured "hyper oscillator" module capable of super-saw and super-pulse sounds through the layering and detuning of up to 88 oscillators. Below are advanced modulation approaches for sculpting unique textures for different musical contexts:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Distorted Percussive Sounds</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Techniques:</strong>
- <strong>Low Voice Count, Extreme Detune:</strong><br />
  Turn the VOICES knob counter-clockwise for only 1–5 oscillators and push DETUNE into the "chaotic" range. This creates inharmonic, clangorous timbres perfect for metallic or bell-like percussion.
- <strong>Transient Modulation:</strong><br />
  Use a short, snappy envelope or trigger (from an EG, function generator, or sequencer) into the FREQ CV. This "pings" the pitch, turning the Swarm into a percussive voice.
- <strong>Waveform Alternation:</strong><br />
  Use the Wave Toggle to switch between sawtooth and pulse. Pulses can produce sharper transients—ideal for snares, claps, or hi-hats when combined with high detune.
- <strong>Patch Through Distortion/Lo-Fi:</strong><br />
  The manual recommends the <strong>2hp Lo-Fi</strong> for digital crunch; patch Swarm’s output into Lo-Fi for glitchy, crushed percussion.
- <strong>Extreme CV Detune Hits:</strong><br />
  Use a random voltage or an LFO with extreme range into DETUNE CV. Rapid, wide detune bursts create stuttering, buzzing drum hits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Patch:</strong><br />
- Attack envelope into FREQ CV<br />
- Random stepped LFO into DETUNE CV<br />
- Swarm out → Lo-Fi → VCA → Mixer/FX  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/Drum &amp; Bass Style)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Techniques:</strong>
- <strong>Many Voices, Heavy Detune:</strong><br />
  Set VOICES to 20–40. Dial DETUNE to taste—first half for thick, tight bass; second half for formant-like or tearing dubstep sounds.
- <strong>VCO Modulation:</strong><br />
  Modulate FREQ CV with an envelope for pitch drops or a synced LFO for vibrato/wobble effects.
- <strong>Waveform Blending:</strong><br />
  Experiment with both waveforms:<br />
  - Saw for thick, Reese-style sub-basses<br />
  - Pulse for squelchy mid-basses (especially with resonance in downstream filtering)
- <strong>Aggressive Filter Mod:</strong><br />
  Pair with the <strong>2hp MMF</strong> filter. Use high resonance and modulate the filter with envelopes or audio-rate LFOs for dynamic movement characteristic of "wobble bass."
- <strong>Parallel VCA Control:</strong><br />
  Route a secondary VCA to modulate the amplitude of Swarm’s DETUNE or VOICES CV, creating evolving, morphing bass textures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Patch:</strong><br />
- Envelope to FREQ CV (for pitch envelope)<br />
- LFO to DETUNE CV<br />
- Sequencer CV to VOICES CV<br />
- Swarm out → MMF (filter modulated by LFO) → VCA (envelope controlled) → Output  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Haunting Atmospheric Pads</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Techniques:</strong>
- <strong>Max Voices, Subtle Detune:</strong><br />
  Set VOICES knob fully clockwise for the max 88 (Saw) or 55 (Pulse) oscillators. Set DETUNE to a sweet spot—first half for lush, analog drift; slightly more for eerie, chorused textures.
- <strong>Slow LFO/Envelope Modulation:</strong><br />
  Slowly modulate DETUNE and/or VOICES with LFOs for evolving pads. Sample &amp; hold or random LFOs can add organic instability.
- <strong>Expressive FREQ CV:</strong><br />
  Modulate FREQ with attenuated, slow LFOs or aftertouch CV for drifting, emotional pitch movement.
- <strong>Processing After Swarm:</strong><br />
  Use heavy reverb and delay. Pairing with <strong>2hp MMF</strong> lets you sculpt pads via gentle high-pass, band-pass, or low-pass filtering, dynamically shifting their spectral character.
- <strong>Crossfade Saw/Pulse:</strong><br />
  Manually switch between waveforms during a performance, or use a sequential switch module to automate moves for evolving timbres.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example Patch:</strong><br />
- Slow triangle LFO to DETUNE CV<br />
- Random LFO to VOICES CV<br />
- Swarm out → MMF → Big reverb/delay → VCA (modulated by envelope for pad articulation)  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>General Modulation Tips</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>All CV Inputs:</strong><br />
  DETUNE, VOICES, and FREQ all accept -5V to +5V (bipolar) CV. This is ideal for using modulation sources with wide ranges and creative offsets.</li>
<li><strong>Polyphonic Madness:</strong><br />
  With up to 88 oscillators, dense stacking and detuning creates ultra-rich tones. Breathy, airy effects arise at max voices with subtle modulation.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Audio-Rate Mod:</strong><br />
  Try patching another fast audio-rate oscillator or the Swarm's own output (via attenuator) back into DETUNE or VOICES CV for FM-style effects or wild chaos.</li>
</ul>

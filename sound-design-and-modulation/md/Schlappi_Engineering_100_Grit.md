# Creative Sound Design with the Schlappi Engineering 100 Grit

The Schlappi Engineering 100 Grit is a wild and hands-on distortion/filter module with unique modulation and "circuit-bending"-style touchpoint capabilities. Here’s how to tap into its most extreme and expressive features for creating **distorted percussive hits, aggressive basslines, and haunting pads**:

---

## 1. **Distorted Percussion**

**Approach**: Use the 100 Grit as a resonant, self-oscillating noise source with touchpoint and CV-driven feedback to create percussive timbres.

### Patch:
- **No external input required:** Set both IN1 and IN2 to around 25–30% or leave unpatched for internal noise generation.
- **GAIN**: ~60% (or push above 75% for more crunch).
- **x100 switch**: ON for extreme distortion.
- **RES CV**: Bring up to excite resonance (try between 25–50%).
- **Suggested Output:** Monitor the DIST output for maximum gnarl.

### Modulation Tricks:
- **Envelope Follower/LFO to TRANSIENTIZE**: Patch a fast envelope or a trigger into the GAIN CV for snappy, percussive attacks.
- **Touch Points**: Simultaneously touch 2–3 brass balls (especially those labeled GAIN CV, DIST 2 AMP PIN, RES CV IN) to inject feedback paths and create glitches, claps, or electro-like percussion.
- **FM Input**: Patch short, high-voltage envelopes (decay shape) into FM1 or FM2 for drum ‘snap’ and weird snare transients.

## 2. **Dubstep/Drum & Bass Basslines**

**Approach**: Push the filter into heavy distortion territory and modulate the cutoff/gain for movement and aggression.

### Patch:
- **Audio Source:** Plug a saw/square wave bass or a complex oscillator into IN1.
- **GAIN:** ~75% for heavy grit; above for madness.
- **RES:** Set by taste—start low, increase for squelchy resonance.
- **FREQUENCY:** 50–80% (sweep for vowel-like effects).
- **CV Routing:**
  - Envelope or LFO to **GAIN CV** for pumping distortion
  - Envelope or sequenced CV to **FM2** to track pitch—FOR V/OCT RESPONSE

### Modulation Tricks:
- **Rate-Modulated FM**: Try patching a fast LFO, audio-rate oscillator, or even noise into FM1 or FM2—move between slow wobbles to filtered FM noise for signature “growl.”
- **Touch Points**: With a finger, bridge the FREQ CV and GAIN CV points to induce wild cross-modulation and tearing bass timbres.
- **X100 Switch**: Flip ON for crunchy, clipped tones.
- **Output:** Use both OUT (for filtered sound) and DIST (for raw distortion). Try layering both.
- **Distorted Feedback (“Normalizations”)**: Unpatch FM1 and let the DIST output normalize to this input for feedback FM—useful for laser and bass sounds.

## 3. **Atmospheric Pads**

**Approach**: Use external sound sources (slow pads, drones), gentle filter modulations, and delicate touchpoint interaction for eerie textures.

### Patch:
- **Audio Source:** Smooth oscillator drone or noise texture into IN1 (and IN2 for stereo or layering effects).
- **GAIN:** 40–65% (subtle grit).
- **RES:** Higher values (50–75%) for self-oscillation and tonal ringing.
- **FREQUENCY**: 30–65%—slowly sweep for evolving tone.

### Modulation Tricks:
- **Slow LFOs:** Patch to FREQ CV for subtle timbral movement.
- **Touch Points:** Gently bridge RES CV IN ↔ DIST 2 OUT or FREQ CV ↔ OUT for electrical “bleed” and evolving tones. Try alligator clips for more stable, hands-free connections!
- **Tape/Noise/Feedback:** Keep the x100 switch OFF for more subtle grain, ON for haunted, broken-radio atmospheres.
- **External Modulation:** Experiment with external random voltages or slow sample-and-hold to act on GAIN, FM, or RES CV for drifting, unpredictable pads.

### **Programming Extra Madness**

- **Utilize Headers:** Experiment with the internal jumpers:
  - **Remove the input-to-resonance jumper** (J9) for more classic, howling self-oscillation on filters.
  - **Change output source (J10)** for less VCA/gain control (direct filter out).

- **CV Crosspatching:** Use touchpoints with patch cables or stackcables to route LFOs, gates, or sequencer notes into input-based touchpoints for unique gestures.

- **Self-Patching:** With all normalizations internally wired, you can create feedback and chaos just by leaving jacks unpatched and exploring the touchpoints.

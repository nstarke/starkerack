# Bastl Cinnamon: Creative Modulation & Sound Design Guide

The **Bastl Cinnamon** is a highly flexible, characterful state-variable filter, offering not only classic filtering but also wild and unique flavors thanks to its *Character* and *Drive* options. Here’s how to push it into new sonic territory for **distorted percussion, basslines, and haunting pads**.

---

## 1. Distorted Percussive Sounds

### Key Controls
- **Drive Switch & Input Level:** Massive gain (up to x10 when Drive is ON) offers intense overdrive and saturation.
- **Character Switches:** Change resonance response for sharper, more aggressive timbres.

### Patch Ideas
- **Drum Samples In:** Send snappy envelopes or drum sounds (claps, snares, short bursts of noise) to the **audio input**. Crank the **Input Level** and engage **Drive** for distortion.
- **Resonant Ping:** Feed a gate or trigger (with a fast, snappy envelope) to the **Cutoff CV**. Max the **Resonance** and self-oscillate for classic “pinged filter” percussion. Engage/flip Character switches for sharper or sawtooth timbres.
- **Voltage-Controlled Mayhem:** Use envelopes or sequencers in the *Right CV* (FM) input. Modulate Attenuator for dynamic response; heavily modulated cutoff + Drive yields complex clangs and zaps.

#### Tip:
Mix outputs (e.g., combine HP + BP out) for complex, punchy hits.

## 2. Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/Drum & Bass Style)

### Key Controls
- **V/Oct Input:** Use 1V/octave signals to “play” the filter; it self-oscillates as an oscillator with high resonance.
- **Character Switches:** Drastically change the waveform and harmonic content.
- **Drive:** Adds rich harmonics and gnarly edge.

### Patch Ideas
- **Wobble Bass:** Patch sequencer or MIDI-to-CV into **V/Oct**. Use an LFO or envelope for **Right CV** to modulate cutoff in sync with the beat, creating classic “dubstep wobble” movement.
- **Extreme Distortion:** High input, Drive ON, and harsh Character switch positions. Modulate Input Level or Character via hand control for live timbral changes.
- **Acid/Resonant Bass:** Feed a saw wave into audio input; set high resonance just below self-oscillation for classic acid/techno basslines. Flip Character switches for new overtones.

#### Tip:
Use the **band-pass output** for more nasal, focused bass; **low-pass out** for heavier subs.

## 3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads

### Key Controls
- **All CV Inputs:** Subtle or evolving modulation creates movement.
- **Resonance:** Medium–high, but not self-oscillating.
- **Character Switches:** Engaged selectively for spectral shifts.

### Patch Ideas
- **Layered Inputs:** Feed evolving soundscapes (textures or chords) into input. Slowly modulate cutoff via slow LFOs, envelopes, or random voltages into both CV inputs.
- **Resonant Drones:** Set sustained resonance; modulate cutoff gently via sample & hold or random voltage. Occasionally switch Character states for eerie harmonic changes.
- **Self-Oscillating Sinus Bed:** Use as sine (or more complex) tone generator with Character switches; mix all three outs (HP, BP, LP) for spatial, phasey atmospheres.

#### Tip:
Automate Drive or Input Level for dynamic “breathing” pad effects as the timbral intensity swells and recedes.

## Bonus Performance Tips

- **Live Tweaks:** Use the Character switches mid-performance to shift energy and surprise listeners.
- **Filtered Feedback:** Send an output back into the input (watch levels!) for unpredictable, evolving color.

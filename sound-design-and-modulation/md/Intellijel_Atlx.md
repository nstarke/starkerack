## Creative Modulation Techniques for the **Atlantix + Atlx Expander**

The **Intellijel Atlantix** paired with the **Atlx Expander** unlocks deep sound design possibilities with its dual oscillators, multi-mode filter, VCA, ADSR, and a wealth of patch points—including the new dedicated waveform/filter outs and ring modulator from Atlx. Below you’ll find modulation concepts and patch ideas tuned for percussive distortion, wild basses (think dubstep/DnB), and lush, eerie pads.

### 1. **Distorted Percussive Sounds**

#### **Patch Idea: "Ring-Mod Drum Machine"**
- **Oscillator Setup:** Mult the envelope to both VCA level and oscillator pitch—snappy envelope for punch.
- **Ring Modulator:** Patch different waveforms (e.g., Saw and Sine from Osc A/B) into X In and Y In. Take the **RING Out** as your main output—this adds metallic, bell-like, or tearing distortion.
- **Filter Distortion:** Send output through both **Lowpass** and **Phazor** filter outs to a mixer; drive the filter hard with hot envelopes or modulate filter cutoff with fast random/LFO for a gritty, almost bit-reduced feel.
- **Extra Touch:** Modulate VCO B’s PWM input with audio-rate signal from VCO A for classic analog "click" and digital noise artifacts.

### 2. **Crazy Basslines (Dubstep, Drum & Bass)**

#### **Patch Idea: "Talking Bass Monster"**
- **BasS VCO:** Take **Sub Square (A)** and **Saw (B)** outs, mix externally or FM one with the other.
- **Filter Animation:** Modulate **filter cutoff** with a multistage envelope or steep LFO for “wobble.” Try using fast random stepped modulation for more DnB flavor.
- **Ring Modulator Resynthesis:** Use the **RING Out** instead of direct oscillator out for gnarlier, formant-like overtones.
- **Self-Patching:** Patch the **Highpass** out to another VCA, then modulate the VCA with an audio-rate source or envelope, adding mid-high sizzle.
- **Bonus:** Route a copy of the audio through the **Paazor** out, sum with the dry signal for extra phasing/smeared dirt.

### 3. **Haunting Atmospheric Pads**

#### **Patch Idea: "Ghost Drift"**
- **Detuned Oscillators:** Use both A and B, slightly detuned, with different waveform outs (Triangle+Sine) mixed.
- **Filter Movement:** Patch slow LFOs or random voltage to filter cutoff via **Lowpass** and **Bandpass** outs simultaneously for movement.
- **Ring Mod Texture:** Send a slow LFO or another oscillator’s sine wave into the ring mod with your pad for evolving, subtle metallic tails. Add **Phazor** out to your mix to introduce swirling, phasey movement.
- **Subtle Distortion:** Gently overdrive the filter by increasing input levels or mixing in some **Saw** with **Sub Square** and process the result through **Bandpass** out for narrow “whistling” effects.

### **Bonus Modulation Tips w/ Atlx**
- **PWM Animation:** Use LFO or audio-rate modulation on Osc A’s PWM (Square wave) for timbral shifts.
- **Self-FM and Filter Feedback:** Patch a filter out (e.g., **Bandpass**) back into the FM input on a VCO or the filter’s own input for chaotic, unstable sounds.
- **Envelope Sculpting:** Mult the ADSR to multiple destinations (VCA, filter, osc pitch, ring mod input) for complex percussive effects.

Leverage the **Atlx expander’s 16 dedicated outputs** for advanced cross-patching, multi-layered modulation, and integrating with external modules—turning the Atlantix into a true sound design laboratory.

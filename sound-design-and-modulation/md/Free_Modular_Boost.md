## Boost (Free Modular) – Creative Modulation Tips

Based on your focus (distorted percussion, crazy basslines, and haunting pads), here’s how you can push the **Boost** module beyond "plain" amplification, even though it has no direct CV inputs!

### 1. Distorted Percussive Sounds

#### Core Idea
- **Use Boost as a post-VCA distortion/final transient designer** for kicks, snares, claps, and other percussive modules.
- The drive/clip circuit creates harmonics, dirt, and punch.

#### Patching Tricks
- **VCA + Envelope Before Boost**: 
  - Patch drum audio (or even white noise/VCF hits) into a VCA.
  - Use a fast envelope to snap the VCA open/closed for tight percussive sounds.
  - The peak from the envelope will slam the Boost, creating more clipping and punch right at the attack.
- **Vary Input Level Per Hit**: 
  - Mult your envelope, CV, or a sequencer to modulate the VCA before Boost—this lets each hit get a different distortion flavor.
  - Try velocity-sensitive envelopes to make some hits really scream.
- **EQ with Tone Control**: 
  - After distortion, use the Tone knob to boost highs (for metallic snares) or tame them (for fatter, less harsh kicks).

### 2. Crazy Dubstep/Drum & Bass Basslines

#### Core Idea
- **Use Boost to add aggressive, analog-style distortion to bass sounds**—make them growl and punch through.

#### Patching Tricks
- **Sub Oscillator/Complex Waveforms into Boost**:
  - Patch an already modulated bass (FM, AM, waveshaped) into Boost—set Drive for heavy distortion.
- **Pre-Emphasis/Filtering**:
  - With Tone to the right, accentuate high harmonics for “biting” bass.
  - With Tone left, hide some of the fizz—good for subby, rounder bass.
- **Dynamic Distortion Edges**:
  - Use an LFO to modulate a VCA before Boost—let the amount of distortion “wobble” rhythmically (typical in aggressive genres).
  - Or, automate the Tone knob by using manual “hands-on” tweaks during recording.

### 3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads

#### Core Idea
- **Boost adds subtle to extreme edge and movement to evolving pads or drones**—moving from lush to eerie.

#### Patching Tricks
- **Blend Gentle and Intense Textures**:
  - Run a lush pad through Boost at moderate Drive for analog grit without destroying detail.
  - For dark, ghostly textures, run two pads—a clean one and a Boosted/distorted one—to a mixer. Crossfade or pan between them.
- **Dynamic Filtering and Drive**:
  - Use a slow LFO or envelope on a VCA before Boost to “breathe” the distortion in/out, making the pad sound alive and unpredictable.
- **Extreme Tone Sculpting**:
  - Crank Tone for “shimmering” spectral effects, or back it off so the pad dissolves into a haunted, muffled ambience.

## Workflow Basics

- **No CV** on Boost itself, BUT you have creative control by **modulating audio level before the module** using a VCA.
- **Tone shaping** lets you further carve the harmonic content.
- For more automation: Sequence VCA levels, or use envelopes/LFOs for living, shifting distortion character.

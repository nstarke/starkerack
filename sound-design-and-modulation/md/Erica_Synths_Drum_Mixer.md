## Modulating the Erica Synths Drum Mixer for Unique Sounds

As a fellow modular artist, here’s a deep dive into how you can modulate your Erica Synths Drum Mixer to sculpt powerful, distorted percussive hits, twisted basslines, and evocative atmospheric pads:

---

### **Module Overview**

This mixer features:
- **7 Audio Inputs** (**IN1–IN7**) with gain structure for overdrive/distortion.
- **Individual Level Controls** and feedback LEDs.
- **Main & Aux Outputs** (with switch routing).
- **Compression Section** (with Comp Amt & Release controls).

Given these features, modulation is achievable via careful patching and CV control elsewhere in your rack—even without dedicated CV inputs on the mixer itself.

### **Distorted Percussive Sounds**

**1. Drive Inputs into Clipping:**
- Each channel’s input is calibrated for max 6dB gain, but driving hot signals will push them into the red, introducing crunchy analog distortion.
- Use drum modules (kicks, snares, hats) and crank their output levels before they hit the mixer. Watch for the LEDs to flash red.

**2. Serial Input Processing:**
- Try stacking (multing) percussion modules, then patching them into several mixer channels.
- Individually boost or cut each, then sum to Main Out for complex, layered distortion.

**3. Feedback Patch:**
- Patch Main Out into a VCA or external effect with gain, then back into one of the IN jacks.
- Modulate feedback levels with envelopes or LFOs for destruction and dynamic attack.

**4. Smash with Compression:**
- Twist the COMP AMT and RELEASE knobs for aggressive sidechain-style pumping.
- For extremely punchy, smashed drums, keep release short and the comp amount high.

### **Glitched & Gritty Basslines**

**1. Saturate Oscillator Bass:**
- Run your bass voice or complex oscillator in hot.
- Use Mixer gain to push harmony, then blend in a drum or random noise to add extra harmonics.

**2. Crossfade Madness:**
- Assign a synth voice to one input, another percussive element or modulated LFO-noise to another.
- Fade between using the level pots—instant wub and movement.

**3. Compress for Slam:**
- Push Comp Amt high, especially for low-frequency material, to create heavy, squashed bass.

**4. Layering:**
- Use multiple IN channels for sub, mid, and top end of basslines, balancing easily on the pots.

### **Atmospheric, Haunting Pads**

**1. Layered Textures:**
- Use several sound sources: drones, filtered noise, granular textures—each to a mixer channel.
- Subtly pan (if panning is available elsewhere in chain) and mix for width.

**2. Compression Swells:**
- Pair slow envelopes into sound sources, then shape dynamics with a longer COMP RELEASE.
- The release makes pads “bloom” or “fade” in eerily.

**3. Parallel FX Routing:**
- Patch “AUX OUT” into a reverb or delay, then return that fx output back into a spare input—route it only to AUX OUT for lush, feedback atmospheres.

**4. Gentle Overdrive:**
- Keep input levels below +5Vpp for clean, smooth pads.
- Push above for subtle saturation and warmth.

---

### **Further Tips**

- **Switch Routings:** Use MAIN/AUX switches to send drum hits or melodic lines to separate buses and fx chains.
- **Feedback with Effects:** Use output-fed-back-to-input for self-oscillation and shrieking drones—modulate the feedback VCA for evolving soundscapes.

This mixer thrives on creative routing and hot signal levels. For live finger-twisting: assign levels and comp controls to performance macros via external CV sources, or just go wild with manual knob wiggling!

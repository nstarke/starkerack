# Erica Synths Black Stereo Reverb: Creative Modulation Techniques

Drawing from the manual, here’s how you can use the Erica Synths Black Stereo Reverb to sculpt **distorted percussive sounds**, **aggressive basslines** for genres like dubstep or drum & bass, and **haunting pads**. This module, with CV over most parameters and a brilliant "freeze" function, offers immense sound design potential.

## 1. Distorted Percussive Sounds

### Key Techniques:
- **Self-Oscillation**: Crank the Feedback knob fully CW to push the module into self-oscillation. Modulate Feedback CV to create bark-like, digital distortion bursts.
- **FREEZE Abuse**: Use a fast trigger or gate sequencer into the FREEZE input to capture transients of percussion or external sounds, then manipulate playback speed (SIZE knob/CV) for glitchy, pitch-warped, or "granular"-like textures.
- **TYPE Switch**: Use the "Dirty BBD" position for a grit-laden, digital distortion character, ideal for industrial, broken drum hits.
- **TONE Knob and CV**: Sharpen or muffle transients by automating TONE CV; try snappy envelopes for “clang” or slow LFOs for evolving textures.
- **MODE Switch**: Try different early/late mix for snappy, hollow, or boomy spaces—great for morphing percussive reverb bodies.

#### Patch Example:
```plaintext
- Feed a fast trigger or snappy envelope (from Maths or other function gen) into FREEZE.
- Send a sharp percussion source or noise burst into L(MONO) IN.
- Modulate SIZE CV with a random stepped or envelope source to re-pitch or stutter captured audio.
- Push Feedback high for noisy crackle.
- Use TONE CV to season the texture—try envelopes or even audio-rate modulation for "ring-modulated" style distortion.

## 2. Crazy Basslines (Dubstep, Drum & Bass)

### Key Techniques:
- **Pitch Tracking**: SIZE CV tracks 1V/Oct, so sequence a bassline from your main sequencer/pitch CV!
- **Type Distortion**: Use “Dirty BBD” for noisy, distorted bass or “Tape” for saturated, saturated rumble.
- **FREEZE**: Sample your bass hit, then repitch/warp it live with SIZE knob/CV.
- **Stereo Spin/Movement**: With the SHIFT button held, rotate the TONE/SPN knob to animate the stereo field, adding movement to otherwise mono bass hits.
- **Kick Feedback**: Patch kick or bass hits, freeze the buffer, then sweep SIZE CV up/down for wobbly bassline effects.

#### Patch Example:
```plaintext
- Feed a bass oscillator or sampled hit into L(MONO) IN.
- Sequence SIZE CV from your 1V/Oct CV sequencer for melodic lines.
- Turn Feedback high for edgy, dirty textures.
- Use MODE to control tightness/looseness of the reverb body (important for sub bass).
- Automate or perform the FREEZE button to create wild jumps & stutters.
```

## 3. Haunting Atmospheric Pads

### Key Techniques:
- **Long FREEZE Loops**: Use the FREEZE function to capture longer, evolving textures (pads, voices), then modulate playback with slow LFOs to SIZE CV for evolving pitch-drift.
- **Cathedral Mode**: Set TYPE to digital and MODE to Cathedral for huge, immersive reverbs.
- **TONE/SPN, Stereo Animation**: Apply slow LFO or random CV to TONE CV for evolving, spectral shimmer; SHIFT + rotate TONE/SPN for stereo washing motion.
- **Preset Morphing**: Use PATCH CV input with a slow, random CV source to morph between saved presets for seamless, morphing atmospheres.
- **Wet/Dry Blending**: Perform or modulate DRY/WET knob for swelling textures.

#### Patch Example:
```plaintext
- Send sustained chords or droning oscillator mixes into L(MONO) IN.
- Set Feedback for long trails, but just before self-oscillation.
- Enable FREEZE at climactic moments to “capture” the pad, then drift SIZE knob/CV for ghostly shifting harmonics.
- Animate TONE/SPN with a slow triangle or random LFO for spectral movement.
- Use PATCH CV with slow LFO for evolutionary changes.
```

## Pro Tips

- **CV Over Everything:** The most unique tones happen when you animate (modulate) multiple parameters at once—experiment with offset, attenuation, and audio-rate modulation.
- **Self-Oscillation as Source:** At high feedback, the reverb itself becomes an oscillator—sample, modulate, and layer for metallic drones or alien percussion.
- **FREEZE = Granular Playground.** Treat FREEZE as a micro-looper/granulator—cycle through pitch, feedback, and tone for endless variation.

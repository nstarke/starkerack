# WMD Crater: Creative Modulation Approaches

Let’s explore the WMD Crater—an earth-shattering hybrid kick drum module—focusing on modulation tricks to coax out extreme distortion, wild bass, and haunting pads from this drum beast.

## 1. **Distorted Percussive Sounds**

- **Saturation CV**: Patch an LFO or envelope (fast, steep shapes work best) into the **Saturation** CV input. Use wide swings into positive **and negative** voltage to get variable amounts of clipping and grit. Try sequencer-triggered envelopes for shifting distortion per hit.  
    - *Tip*: Negative CV will **attenuate** the signal, great for sudden drops or weird “thudding” effects.

- **Clipping Switch**:  
    - *Middle Position*: Modulates in as the decay proceeds—great for kicks that decay from crunchy to clean.
    - *Right Position*: Leaves the circuit fully clipped—this is straight-up gabber/noise territory.

- **Click Timbre & Level**:  
    - Use CV switches/sequencer outputs into click-related parameters. Fast switching and/or sample & hold modulation through the 14 available timbres can get glitchy, IDM-style percussion.

- **Pitch Envelope Amount + Decay**:  
    - Max out both for laser/rave percussion; sequence the **Decay** for pseudo-909 “rat-tat-tat” effects.

## 2. **Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/Drum & Bass)**

- **Sustain Mode**:  
    - Patch a gate/keyboard/sequencer into **Trigger** and activate **Sustain**—now you have a beefy synth voice!
    - Sequence *melodies* using the **1V/OCT** input.

- **Modulate Pitch Envelope**:
    - Use stepped/random CV to **Pitch Envelope Amount** or **Pitch Decay** for wobbly, popping bass.

- **Combine Saturation + Clipping**:  
    - Use intense envelope or LFO modulation on **Saturation** while in **max clip** mode for bristling, digital overdriven bass.

- **Accentuate**:
    - Alternate between regular and accented triggers to alternate between “clean” and “rowdy” bass notes.

## 3. **Haunting Atmospheric Pads**

- **Long Decay**:  
    - Max out the **Decay** (oscillator portion) to let tones bloom and fade.
    - Use a continuous gate for **Sustain**—now modules like Crater can hold out notes for pad-like drones.

- **Pitch Modulation**:  
    - Slow, evolving LFOs to **Pitch** and **Pitch Envelope Amount** create eerie, subtle movement in the pad sound.

- **Click Decay/Level**:
    - Set **Click Level** low and add some *white-noise* character with **Click Timbre** at longer decays for atmospheric “shimmer.”

- **Saturation Wandering**:  
    - Slow random/slewed CV on **Saturation** adds lo-fi, old-tape instability.

- **Atmospheric Tricks**:  
    - Pair Crater with reverb and chorus modules after its output for lush, “breathing” kicks.

## **Bonus Patch Examples**

**Distorted Kick Arp**
  1. Envelope (from sequencer) to **Saturation CV**
  2. LFO (medium-fast) to **Pitch Envelope Amount**
  3. Set to max **Clipping**
  4. Experiment with different **Click Timbres** per step

**Dubstep Reece Bass**
  1. Gate/keyboard/sequencer to **Trigger + 1V/OCT**
  2. Envelope to **Saturation**
  3. LFO to **Pitch Decay**
  4. Max **Sustain**
  5. (Optional) Sequence **Clipping** and/or accent inputs per step

**Haunted Drone**
  1. Hold gate high at **Trigger**; modulate **Pitch** with slow LFO
  2. Slowly modulate **Sustain** and **Decay** for subtle bloom/fade
  3. Set **Click Level** low, long **Click Decay**
  4. Gentle LFO on **Saturation**
  5. Feed output to long, dark reverb

# Creative Modulation Techniques for 2hp Swarm  
*(Focusing on Distorted Percussive Sounds, Aggressive Basslines, and Atmospheric Pads)*

---

The **2hp Swarm** is a compact but highly-featured "hyper oscillator" module capable of super-saw and super-pulse sounds through the layering and detuning of up to 88 oscillators. Below are advanced modulation approaches for sculpting unique textures for different musical contexts:

---

## 1. **Distorted Percussive Sounds**

**Techniques:**
- **Low Voice Count, Extreme Detune:**  
  Turn the VOICES knob counter-clockwise for only 1–5 oscillators and push DETUNE into the "chaotic" range. This creates inharmonic, clangorous timbres perfect for metallic or bell-like percussion.
- **Transient Modulation:**  
  Use a short, snappy envelope or trigger (from an EG, function generator, or sequencer) into the FREQ CV. This "pings" the pitch, turning the Swarm into a percussive voice.
- **Waveform Alternation:**  
  Use the Wave Toggle to switch between sawtooth and pulse. Pulses can produce sharper transients—ideal for snares, claps, or hi-hats when combined with high detune.
- **Patch Through Distortion/Lo-Fi:**  
  The manual recommends the **2hp Lo-Fi** for digital crunch; patch Swarm’s output into Lo-Fi for glitchy, crushed percussion.
- **Extreme CV Detune Hits:**  
  Use a random voltage or an LFO with extreme range into DETUNE CV. Rapid, wide detune bursts create stuttering, buzzing drum hits.

> **Example Patch:**  
> - Attack envelope into FREQ CV  
> - Random stepped LFO into DETUNE CV  
> - Swarm out → Lo-Fi → VCA → Mixer/FX

## 2. **Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/Drum & Bass Style)**

**Techniques:**
- **Many Voices, Heavy Detune:**  
  Set VOICES to 20–40. Dial DETUNE to taste—first half for thick, tight bass; second half for formant-like or tearing dubstep sounds.
- **VCO Modulation:**  
  Modulate FREQ CV with an envelope for pitch drops or a synced LFO for vibrato/wobble effects.
- **Waveform Blending:**  
  Experiment with both waveforms:  
  - Saw for thick, Reese-style sub-basses  
  - Pulse for squelchy mid-basses (especially with resonance in downstream filtering)
- **Aggressive Filter Mod:**  
  Pair with the **2hp MMF** filter. Use high resonance and modulate the filter with envelopes or audio-rate LFOs for dynamic movement characteristic of "wobble bass."
- **Parallel VCA Control:**  
  Route a secondary VCA to modulate the amplitude of Swarm’s DETUNE or VOICES CV, creating evolving, morphing bass textures.

> **Example Patch:**  
> - Envelope to FREQ CV (for pitch envelope)  
> - LFO to DETUNE CV  
> - Sequencer CV to VOICES CV  
> - Swarm out → MMF (filter modulated by LFO) → VCA (envelope controlled) → Output

## 3. **Haunting Atmospheric Pads**

**Techniques:**
- **Max Voices, Subtle Detune:**  
  Set VOICES knob fully clockwise for the max 88 (Saw) or 55 (Pulse) oscillators. Set DETUNE to a sweet spot—first half for lush, analog drift; slightly more for eerie, chorused textures.
- **Slow LFO/Envelope Modulation:**  
  Slowly modulate DETUNE and/or VOICES with LFOs for evolving pads. Sample & hold or random LFOs can add organic instability.
- **Expressive FREQ CV:**  
  Modulate FREQ with attenuated, slow LFOs or aftertouch CV for drifting, emotional pitch movement.
- **Processing After Swarm:**  
  Use heavy reverb and delay. Pairing with **2hp MMF** lets you sculpt pads via gentle high-pass, band-pass, or low-pass filtering, dynamically shifting their spectral character.
- **Crossfade Saw/Pulse:**  
  Manually switch between waveforms during a performance, or use a sequential switch module to automate moves for evolving timbres.

> **Example Patch:**  
> - Slow triangle LFO to DETUNE CV  
> - Random LFO to VOICES CV  
> - Swarm out → MMF → Big reverb/delay → VCA (modulated by envelope for pad articulation)

## **General Modulation Tips**

- **All CV Inputs:**  
  DETUNE, VOICES, and FREQ all accept -5V to +5V (bipolar) CV. This is ideal for using modulation sources with wide ranges and creative offsets.
- **Polyphonic Madness:**  
  With up to 88 oscillators, dense stacking and detuning creates ultra-rich tones. Breathy, airy effects arise at max voices with subtle modulation.
- **Extreme Audio-Rate Mod:**  
  Try patching another fast audio-rate oscillator or the Swarm's own output (via attenuator) back into DETUNE or VOICES CV for FM-style effects or wild chaos.

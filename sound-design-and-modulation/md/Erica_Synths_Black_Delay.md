# Creative Erica Synths Black Stereo Delay Modulation Techniques

**Module in Focus:**  
Erica Synths Black Stereo Delay (BSD)  
A deep, stereo, DSP-powered delay module – perfect for pushing into experimental, gritty, and atmospheric sonic realms!

Below are sound design strategies based on the BSD features, tailored for **distorted percussive sounds**, **wobbly/crazy basslines**, and **haunting pads**.

## Modulating For Distorted Percussive Sounds

1. **Feedback Overload & Self-Oscillation**
   - **Turn FEEDBACK fully CW** to drive the delay into self-oscillation.  
   - Use short **DELAY TIMES** (3-30ms) to generate metallic, dirty slapback tones.
   - **Patch an Envelope or Sequencer to FBK CV**: Percussive envelope modulation at feedback CV in can create clicky, saturated sound artifacts.

2. **CV-Controlled Glitch & Stutter**
   - **TRIGGER INPUT > HOLD/ADD:** Use a fast/random rhythm trigger to loop and overdub short audio fragments for granular, choppy effects.
   - **Reverse Trigger**: Randomly reverse slices for glitch effects.

3. **Extreme Tape/Spread Effects**
   - **TAPE MODE** introduces pitch artifacts at short delay times.  
   - **Stereo Spread:** Hold ADD + turn TIME to max for big left/right jitter. Route percussion through and automate spread for stereo tearing.

4. **Wavefolder/Distortion Combo**
   - **HOT INPUTS:** Drive hot drum or glitch signals into the IN LVL knob past 12 o’clock for in-circuit “saturation.”
   - **Feedback Path:** Use a CV modulator (sample & hold or LFO) to wiggle FBK CV rapidly, creating digital distortion bursts.

## Creating Crazy Basslines (Dubstep/Drum & Bass Tones)

1. **Wobble via Delay Time Modulation**
   - **TIME CV Input:** Patch a bipolar LFO or envelope follower to TIME CV. Set a medium delay time (60-200 ms) in DIGITAL MODE (no pitch shift) for “tearing” comb-filter bass when fed with sub-bass.
   - **ADIABATIC Feels:** Slow manual tweaks in TAPE MODE will pitch-shift the repeats for classic dubstep LFO movement.

2. **Feedback Crunch**
   - **CV-Controlled Feedback:** Use an LFO or stepped-random source to modulate FBK CV, automating drive/chaos.

3. **Syncopated/Polyrhythmic Effects**
   - **TAP or Ext Clock Input:** Sync delay to groove, then unsync (move TIME) for “shrinking” bass stutters or breaks.

4. **Reverse Bass Mayhem**
   - **Reverse Trigger:** Momentarily flip the REVERSE mode for mangled, reversed reverb tails on bass, giving DnB breaks a live feel.

## Haunting, Atmospheric Pads & Soundscapes

1. **Slow CV Modulation: Pad Smear**
   - **MIX CV Input:** Use slow random LFO or S&H to fade between dry/wet for subtle pad morphing.
   - **TIME CV:** Slowly modulate TIME or manually nudge for ghostly spectral shifts.

2. **Hold Buffer Drone**
   - **HOLD Mode:** Sample a pad or chord, then switch hold on for looping ambience.
   - **ADD Overdub:** Periodically overdub new fragments (with manual IN LVL) for evolving drone pads.
   - **Stereo Spread:** In Hold Mode, set stereo spread wide for a super-wide atmospheric field.

3. **Ping-Pong & Multi-Tap**
   - **Ping Pong with Spread:** Set PING PONG mode ON, then widen stereo spread for engulfing, L/R bouncing echoes that create intricate textures.

4. **Reverse Shimmer**
   - **Reverse in Hold:** Layer HOLD + REVERSE for ghostly, backward-moving pads, especially with shimmer/chorus upstream or downstream in your patch.

5. **Feedback Texture Generator**
   - **Feedback On the Edge:** Set feedback just below oscillation—slowly raise for endless, decaying washes that evolve over time. CV slow modulation makes the texture undulate.

### Additional Tips

- **Feedback Loop Externalization:** Route OUT R to a distortion, then back into IN L, with feedback very low, for an analog-style feedback insert.
- **Use Both Mono Inputs:** Patch contrasting percussion and melodic lines to IN L/IN R for complex stereo delays.
- **Abuse The Input Level:** Use IN LVL creatively—high for saturation, low for clean shimmer, modulated for evolving character.

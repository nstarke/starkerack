# Creative Modulation with Integra Funkitus  
## For Distorted Percussion, Dubstep Basslines, and Haunting Atmospheres

The **Integra Funkitus** is a highly flexible 4-part rhythm modifier. Using its probability-based and logic-based rhythm combining, you can transform even the simplest eurorack gate sequences into dynamic, complex, and modulated material. Here’s how you can exploit its features to shape sounds for different advanced music production targets.

## Module Recap

- **Inputs:** 4 gate inputs (accepts >2V)  
- **Outputs:** 4 gate outputs (sends 6V gate)
- **Modes:** Trigger, Gate (both probabilistic), Logic mode
- **CV modulation:** 4 CV inputs (one per channel, attenuverted by front panel knob)
- **Burn Button:** Forces all inputs to all outputs for instant rhythmic fills

## 1. Creating Distorted Percussive Sounds

### Techniques:
- **Feed Standard Patterns:** Patch rigid single-channel/clocked patterns from a source like a Numeric Repetitor.
- **Use Gate Mode:** Probability applied to both rising/falling edges can produce choked, overlong, or asymmetrical gates. These “broken” gates can overdrive or glitch responsive drum voices, especially analog modules with audio-rate gate compatibility.
    - **Tip:** Modulate the gate probability with noisy, stepped random CV for more unpredictable distortion and trigger misfires.
- **Logic Mode Processing:** Combine all input patterns with logic modes; turn the knob to crossfade between "one-to-one" and complex combinations.
    - **Automation:** Sequence or manually "sweep" the logic knob (with or without CV) for rhythmic “bursts” and digital chaos.
- **External Distortion:** Use the glitchy, choking, or extended gates to trigger analog overdrive, wavefolder, or bitcrusher modules for extra crunch.
- **Burn:** Stab or sequence the Burn button (via manual tap or clocked trigger, if so modified) to create dramatic fills or one-off walls of percussive chaos.

## 2. Generating Crazy Dubstep/Drum & Bass Basslines

### Techniques:
- **Trigger Mode Grooves:** Set the input gates from fast, swung, or shuffled triggers from trigger/gate sequencers.
    - **Probability Modulation:** Apply fast LFOs or sample & hold CV to the channel modulation jacks. Smearing gate pass-through causes "groove slop" and pseudo-random rhythm drops—a staple for complex D&B grooves.
    - **Output to Bass Voice EGs:** Use the output gates to trigger bass synths, wavetable voices, or complex envelope generators controlling FM depth, filter cutoff, or waveshaping.
- **Bass "Tearouts":** In Gate Mode, gates can become sticky or elongated, causing envelope retriggers or missed notes—useful for odd, syncopated sub patterns or heavy "wobble" accents.
- **Logic Mode Bass Carving:** Use as a "pattern morpher" by CV-modulating between pure and combined logic states, producing basslines that mutate in real-time.
- **Layer Noise or Sub Bass:** Parallel the output to both a percussive module (for click/transient) and a filtered, sine/triangle-rich voice for sub harmony.

## 3. Making Haunting Atmospheric Pads

### Techniques:
- **Slow Gates in Gate Mode:** Use long, slow rhythmic inputs (or even LFOs with sharp slopes as gates) and low pass probability to generate sparse, ghostly note triggers for pad or string synths.
- **Randomized Logic Scenes:** In Logic Mode, slowly modulate the logic knob positions with attenuated random CV or slow LFOs. Pads will “grow” and “recede” unpredictably, with gates drifting between channels.
- **Reverb and Delay Modulation:** Send Integra Funkitus’s outputs through slow-attack envelopes to modulate VCA levels, send gates to control mix levels on reverbs/delays, or trigger shimmer FX for evolving pads.
- **Burn Button FX:** Slowly tap or mathematically clock the Burn function to create unpredictable swarms or bursts of harmony, especially effective with lush reverb and verb/delay feedback paths.

## General Tips

- **CV Modulation is Key:** The rhythm modification jacks are powerful—use sources like random voltage, attenuated LFO, or sequenced modulation to make the module “play itself.”
- **Attenuate for Subtlety:** The knobs act as attenuators for incoming CV—experiment with small modulations for subtle instability, or full sweeps for radical morphing.
- **Use All Modes Per Patch:** Don’t be afraid to switch between modes live—each mode can create vastly different “feels” from the same input rhythms.

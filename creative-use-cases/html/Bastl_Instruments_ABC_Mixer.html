<h2>Creative Uses for the Bastl Instruments ABC 6-Channel Mixer</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bastl ABC Mixer</strong> is a flexible 6-channel utility ideal for both audio and CV mixing, with a particular feature set that invites a variety of creative eurorack patching opportunities. Here are some inspiring and practical ways to make the most out of this module in your modular system, including suggestions for combinations with other module types or specific modules.</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. <strong>Parallel Audio Processing and Crossfading</strong></h3>
<p>With its dual submix outputs (<strong>A+B+C</strong>, <strong>D+E+F</strong>) and the normalization feature:
- <strong>Stereo Imaging:</strong> Use jumpers to normalize A→D, B→E, C→F, then patch audio sources into A, B, C, use D, E, F for parallel processed versions (through effects like delay, reverb, filters), and output each group as L/R stereo channels.
    - <em>Recommended Modules</em>: Mutable Instruments Veils for additional VCAs, Make Noise Mimeophon for creative delay/reverb, Intellijel Quad VCA for further mixing/crossfading.
- <strong>Parallel FX Processing:</strong> Route a drum mix to A, B, C; send the ABC output to a reverb, its return to D, E, or F; blend dry and wet signals interactively with the ABC mixer.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Flexible CV Mixing and Routing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convert for CV Mixing:</strong> Use solder jumpers to make the mixer DC-coupled and mix modulation sources (LFOs, envelopes).<ul>
<li>Combine multiple LFOs (XAOC Batumi, Intellijel Quadra, or Doepfer A-145) to generate complex multi-layered modulation signals for a filter cutoff or oscillator FM input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Performance Macros:</strong> Combine gates, triggers, or stepped voltages (e.g., from a Make Noise Maths or ALM Pamela's Pro Workout) for complex rhythmic modulation or performance macros.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Complex Oscillator Layering</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oscillator Mixing:</strong> Layer multiple VCOs (e.g., Mutable Plaits, Intellijel Dixie II+, or classic Doepfer A-110) in A, B, C for a "super-oscillator," mix together, or split some through waveshapers/effects and return via D, E, F for harmonic richness.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Grouping:</strong> Mix up to 6 voices together for quick summing before hitting a low-pass filter or VCA (Mutable Ripples, Doepfer A-132-3).</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Joystick-Style Performance Control</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voltage Macro Mixer:</strong> Feed modulation sources into channels, use ABC mixer for summed performance controls—ideal with pressure sensors (Make Noise Pressure Points) or joysticks (Intellijel Planar, Erica Synths Joystick).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>CV-Controlled Stereo Panning</strong></h3>
<p>With normalized ABC≠DEF, and utilizing external VCAs and panners:
- <strong>DIY Stereo Panning:</strong> Feed audio into A, B, C, and their CV-panned versions (via VCA or panner modules like Doepfer A-134-1) into D, E, F. Mix for manual or automated panning across the stereo field.</p>
<h3>6. <strong>Drum &amp; Percussion Submix</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drum Sum:</strong> Patch individual drum voices (e.g., TipTop Audio 808/909 modules, Noise Engineering Basimilus Iteritas) into each channel for tight, hands-on submixing before hitting final compression or effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. <strong>Feedback Looper and Drones</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Patch D+E+F output back into one of the A, B, C inputs through an effect (e.g., delay module), and blend for controlled feedback experiments—great for drones, glitches, or evolving soundscapes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Additional Tips</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Programming:</strong> The hands-on gain knobs are great for live improv—fade elements in/out, blend sources, or abruptly mute by turning fully counterclockwise.</li>
<li><strong>Stereo Tricks:</strong> Combine two mono signals in left/right fashion by splitting ABC → L, DEF → R, useful for stereo imaging before final out.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Utilities:</strong> Use it as a master mixer, utility submixer, or as a dedicated modulation summing point—quickly re-route on the fly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creative Uses for Mutable Instruments Ripples in Your Eurorack System</h2>
<p>Mutable Instruments Ripples is a feature-rich, characterful multi-mode filter with voltage control over resonance and a built-in VCA. Its compactness and flexible design open up a wide palette of creative modular patching options. Here’s how you can push Ripples beyond traditional filtering roles by integrating it with other modules:</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. <strong>Classic Subtractive Voice</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> VCO (analog or digital), Envelope Generator, Sequencer or Keyboard, VCA<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Patch your VCO output(s) into Input 1 of Ripples for a saturated, soft-clipped sound, or Input 2 for a clean sound.
- Use the built-in VCA at the LP output as your final stage — patch an envelope into the VCA CV input for classic VCF → VCA subtractive patches without needing an extra VCA module.
- Apply an LFO or Envelope to the Cutoff CV for evolving timbral motion.
- Use the 24dB/oct setting for a smooth, creamy character reminiscent of ‘80s Japanese synths, or 12dB/oct for a more open sound.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. <strong>Pinged Filter Drums &amp; Percussion</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Envelope/Function Generator (e.g., Maths, Make Noise Function), Trigger Source (e.g., a sequencer or clock)<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- With Resonance set high (just before or at self-oscillation), "ping" the Cutoff CV input with short triggers or envelopes.
- Adjust cutoff to tune the frequency, use the built-in VCA input to shape amplitude.
- You can create resonant analog kick drums, toms, or blips — especially interesting when sequenced rhythmically.
- Mult your triggers to strike both the Cutoff CV and VCA CV for richer envelopes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. <strong>Stereo Animation and Multimode Processing</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Stereo Signal Source, Dual LFO or Stereo Modulation Source, Multiple VCAs<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Process left and right signals separately using multiple outputs (e.g., HP for left, BP for right, or two LPs with different cutoff modulations).
- Animate each channel’s cutoff with independent LFOs or random voltages for evolving stereo fields.
- Combine Ripples’ colored outputs with other multimode filters for crossfaded or recombined stereo filter sweeps.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. <strong>Filter as Resonator/Oscillator</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Sequencer or Keyboard, Attenuator, Mixer (optional)<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Crank the resonance to self-oscillation, turning Ripples into a sinewave oscillator you can play melodically.
- Sequence pitch via the V/OCT input for simple melodies or layered harmonic content alongside your regular VCOs.
- You can use the Bandpass or Highpass outputs for different timbres.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. <strong>Creative Modulation via External CV</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Expressive CV sources (e.g., Pressure Points, Planar, random generators), Sample &amp; Hold<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Modulate the VCA CV input with randomized or gestural voltages to create animated filter amplitude effects — try slewed random voltage for smooth dynamic morphing.
- Use an envelope follower from an external audio source (drum machine, vocal, etc.) to impart dynamic, sidechain-like movement on the filtered signal.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. <strong>Complex FM Filtering</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Audio-rate Oscillator (for FM), Envelope, Mixer/Attenuator<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Patch another VCO into the FM CV input and set the attenuverter to taste.
- Experiment with audio-rate cutoff modulation to achieve clangorous, metallic timbres (classic "filter FM").
- Blend in control-rate modulation with an envelope or LFO for dramatic sweep and motion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. <strong>Parallel &amp; Series Filtering</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Other Filters (Doepfer A-124, Mutable Blades, etc.), Mixers<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Run a signal through Ripples, then through another filter for double filtering, or split your audio to run in parallel through different filter types and mix back together.
- Use this for thickening, stereoizing, or morphing between radically different timbres.</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. <strong>Feedback Patches</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Mixer, Attenuator, Delay or Reverb Module<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Route the BP or HP output back into an input (attenuated), or to the input of a delay/reverb before returning to Ripples for Karplus-Strong/plucked string effects and wild self-patched textures.
- Voltage control the resonance for feedback that evolves in dynamics and timbre.</p>
<hr />
<h3>9. <strong>Performance-oriented Filter Rides</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong> Macro controller, Joystick, Macro Expression Pedal<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
- Assign a performance control to multiple CV destinations: cutoff, resonance, and VCA level, for hands-on morphing and performative sweeps.</p>

<h2>Specific Module Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mutable Instruments Stages / Maths</strong> (complex envelopes, triggers for pinging)</li>
<li><strong>Xaoc Devices Batumi, ALM Pamela’s PRO Workout</strong> (quad LFOs/modulation sources)</li>
<li><strong>Intellijel Quad VCA</strong> (mix or CV blend of outputs)</li>
<li><strong>Make Noise Pressure Points / Planar2</strong> (expressive gesture control)</li>
<li><strong>Doepfer A-118, Wogglebug</strong> (random/stepped CV)</li>
<li><strong>Mutable Instruments Plaits, Rings</strong> (great sources to feed Ripples for percussion/resonator fun)</li>
<li><strong>Stereo mixers</strong> (for creative multichannel or parallel filtering)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Ripples is a superbly crafted filter that blends classic musicality with modern patch flexibility. Don’t hesitate to use its VCA and resonance features in surprising ways, and combine it with modulation and mangling sources for adventure!</p>

<h1>Creative Patch Ideas for 2hp Switch (Voltage-Controlled Router)</h1>
<p>The <strong>2hp Switch</strong> is a compact, voltage-controlled four-way router for audio, CV, or gate signals—allowing either manual or CV selection of the active input. Its ability to dynamically steer between sources makes it incredibly versatile in a modular setup. Below are several patch ideas and module pairings to maximize its creative potential:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Morphing Modulation Sources</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Route four different LFOs or envelopes (from modules like Make Noise Maths, Intellijel Quadra, or Doepfer A-147) into the four Switch inputs, and send the output to a filter cutoff or oscillator pitch CV.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Use a sequencer or random CV generator (like Mutable Instruments Marbles or Make Noise Wogglebug) into the SEL CV input to automate source selection.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Rhythmic or unpredictable changes in modulation, evolving over time or on command.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Automated Audio Source Selection</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Route various oscillators, noise sources, or processed sound textures (from voices like Mutable Instruments Plaits, Noise Engineering Basimilus, etc.) into Switch.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Send the output to effects or straight to the mixer. Use a clock divider or step sequencer to control the SEL CV for automated rhythm-based switching.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Quickly alternate between timbrally contrasting sound sources for glitchy, chopped, or morphing timbres in a performance or recording.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Step-Addressable Gate or Trigger Router</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Patch four different rhythmic trigger sources (e.g., Euclidean Circles, Pamela’s New Workout, or the Erica Pico Trigger) into Switch.</li>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Use the SEL CV to select which pattern or rhythm passes through to a drum module or envelope generator.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Evolving drum patterns or stochastic rhythms, with the SEL knob or CV dictating rhythm flow.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>Voltage-Controlled Signal Selector in Feedback/FX Loops</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Use Switch to route four different effect returns or feedback tap points (from modules like FX AID, Mimeophon, or Spring Reverb returns).</li>
<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> SEL CV could come from a random or chaotic CV generator for wild, evolving FX routings.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Dynamic feedback system or real-time effects mangling, with quick auditioning of various processes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. <strong>Preset Morphing in Live Performance</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Pre-patch four different parameter configurations (e.g., four filtered or wavefolded versions of one voice) and switch between them live.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Map SEL CV to a foot pedal (via an expression pedal-to-CV module) for hands-free scene switching on stage.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Instantly jump between drastically different sounds or sound worlds with precise or spontaneous control.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. <strong>Time-Based Logical CV Routing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Send four logic pattern outputs (from a module like Mutable Instruments Branches, Doepfer A-166, or Ladik S-186) into Switch.</li>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Use a sequencer or manually modulated CV to drive SEL, effectively re-routing complex CV logic based on voltage-controlled "logic presets."</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Advanced self-generating or algorithmic patching, unlocking generative complexity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tips &amp; Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the Switch’s <strong>fast response time</strong> to audio-rate modulate the SEL input for digital-esque timbral effects or aggressive wave splicing.</li>
<li>Pair with sample-and-hold modules or slew limiters to smooth or step the SEL CV for predictable or stepped transitions.</li>
<li>Use a quantized SEL CV (e.g., from an analog sequencer) to guarantee clean, precise selection in time with the music.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Module Recommendations for Pairing:</strong>
- Mutable Instruments Marbles (random/sequenced CV)
- Make Noise Maths (envelopes/LFOs)
- Intellijel Tetrapad (manual touch CV)
- Pamela’s New Workout (clock/gate/trigger/gen)
- XAOC Batumi (multiple synced LFOs)
- Mutable Instruments Branches (logic patterns)</p>

<h2>Creative Uses for the Eris 4x4 Matrix Mixer in a Modular Synthesizer System</h2>
<p>The <strong>Altered State Machines Eris</strong> 4x4 matrix mixer offers a wealth of creative patching possibilities thanks to its unique routing, DC coupling, and CV/audio capabilities. Here are some advanced and interesting ways you might use the Eris in your setup, along with relevant module recommendations:</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. Multi-FX Send/Return Matrix</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Connect your primary oscillator(s) or voice(s) to the Eris inputs.
- Send the 4 outputs to four different effects modules (e.g., <strong>Make Noise Mimeophon, Mutable Instruments Beads, Strymon Magneto, or Erica Synths Fusion Delay</strong>).
- Return the effects' outputs to another mixer, or back to Eris’s Aux In.
- Use the matrix to blend dry/wet effects, create parallel processing chains, or even feedback mixes by routing effect outputs back to Eris inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
Complex, evolving textures and chained effects mixes—highly customizable send/return routing usually found in high-end consoles.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Feedback and No-Input Mixing</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Patch Eris's outputs back into its own inputs to create a "no-input" mixer situation.
- Insert filters (e.g., <strong>Doepfer A-124 Wasp Filter</strong>), distortion units, or delays in between the feedback loops.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
Self-generating drones, complex feedback tones, and experimental soundscapes reminiscent of old analog mixers used as sound sources.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. CV Routing and Cross-Modulation Matrix</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Send up to four modulation sources (e.g., <strong>ALM Pamela’s Pro Workout, Make Noise Maths, Mutable Instruments Stages</strong>) into Eris inputs.
- Route and attenuate blends of these CV signals to four different destinations (oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, VCA, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
Highly dynamic, interwoven modulations, perfect for generative patches or animated sound design.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Polyrhythmic Drum/Trigger Matrix</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Route triggers/gates from different sequencers (e.g., <strong>Intellijel Metropolix, 4ms Quad Clock Distributor</strong>) or drum machines into Eris.
- Send blended, attenuated, or even overdriven signals to trigger/clock various drum voices (e.g., <strong>Noise Engineering Basimilus Iteritas Alter, Mutable Instruments Peaks</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
Create composite or probability-based rhythms, hybrid percussion triggers, and morphing drum patterns.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Audio-to-CV Distortion/Mangling</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Use Eris as a waveshaping signal processor for CV (by running LFOs/envelopes hot into x4 gain), or for overdriving and distorting audio.
- Route the distorted output into envelope followers (<strong>Doepfer A-119</strong>, <strong>Mutable Instruments Ears</strong>) for dynamic CV generation.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
Responsive, highly distorted CV or audio signals that can turn subtle modulation into wild shapes or drive filters/VCAs unusually.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. Performance Mixer with Mutes</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Use the aux channel and vactrol-based soft mute to bring in external gear, sidechain signals, or live input (vocal mic, external synth).
- Gently fade in/out sections or transitions live without clicks or pops.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
A tactile, smooth-performance mixer solution for hands-on sets.</p>
<hr />
<h3>7. Cybernetic/Compounded Feedback Networks</h3>
<p><strong>How-To:</strong><br />
- Integrate the Eris within a feedback chain; outputs from delays, reverbs (e.g., <strong>Strymon Magneto</strong>, <strong>Tiptop Z-DSP</strong>) are routed back into the mixer.
- Use the Eris gain stages to control the amount and type of feedback precisely.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
Self-generating pads, endlessly evolving atmospheres, and new "instruments" created from feedback.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Generic Module Type Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Oscillators:</strong> Route different waves into/out of Eris for FM/AM mixes.</li>
<li><strong>Function Generators (Maths, Function, Rampage):</strong> For evolving CV blends.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Followers, VCAs, or Ring Modulators:</strong> For processing and shaping signals further.</li>
<li><strong>Sequencers &amp; Logic Modules:</strong> For creative CV/gate mixing.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Bonus Patching Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Flip the back panel switch for x2 gain on the Aux input and creatively overdrive external synths, drum machines, or microphones.</li>
<li>Use Eris as a pseudo-quadraphonic distributor, sending audio or CV to different speakers/effects chains.</li>
<li>Can serve as a preset morph system: carefully set up the matrix, and with minimal knob tweaks, shift between drastically different patch routings.</li>

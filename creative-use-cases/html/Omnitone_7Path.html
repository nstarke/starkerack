<h2>Creative Uses for 7Path – Ethernet Patch Cable Bridge</h2>
<p>The <strong>7Path</strong> is a passive Eurorack module system that allows you to patch up to 7 signals between two different points—either within a single large case or, more likely, between two separate cases—using a standard Ethernet cable. Each input/output is a direct, point-to-point connection (1:1), and it works with any Eurorack-level signal (CV, gate, audio, triggers).</p>
<h3><strong>1. Distributed Polyphonic Patching</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: If you have separate cases for voices (e.g., all oscillators in one case, modulation/sequencers in another), 7Path can streamline polyphonic sending/receiving.</li>
<li><strong>Modules to combine</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Polyphonic MIDI-CV modules</strong> (e.g., <em>Expert Sleepers FH-2</em>, <em>Doepfer A-190-5</em>) in one case connected to several oscillators or voices in another case.</li>
<li>Use 7Path to pipe 7 independent pitch &amp; gate pairs for 3-voice polyphony plus modulation or aftertouch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Ultimate Performance System Interconnect</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Connect your "studio case" to a portable/jam case without losing signal integrity or cluttering with long cables.</li>
<li><strong>Modules to combine</strong>:<ul>
<li>A <em>performance controller</em> (e.g., <em>Make Noise Pressure Points</em>, <em>Intellijel Tetrapad</em>) in one case, patched via 7Path to sound modules/effects in the other.</li>
<li>Jam with friends whose systems sit on another table, using the 7Path to send triggers, clocks, or audio between systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Spatial Audio/Efx Routing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Send multichannel audio across a room to remote effects, multi-speaker setups, or tape loops.</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>:<ul>
<li>Send dry signals to a <em>dedicated FX skiff</em> with one or more effect modules (e.g., <em>Mutable Instruments Clouds, Tiptop Z-DSP</em>).</li>
<li>Return wet signals back or simultaneously send clock/resets for synced effects processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. System-Wide Modulation Bus</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Distribute global modulation sources from a “mod skiff” to multiple targets in a main rack.</li>
<li><strong>Modules to combine</strong>:<ul>
<li><em>Maths</em>, <em>LFOs</em>, <em>Random sources</em> (e.g., <em>Mutable Instruments Tides, Malekko Noise</em>), routed across the 7Path to modulate separate voices, VCAs, or filters in another case.</li>
<li>Centralize modulation depth and variety in one place for complex, system-wide automation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Remote Clock/Sync Distribution</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Maintain rhythmic synchronicity across sprawling systems or for live setups.</li>
<li><strong>Modules to combine</strong>:<ul>
<li>Clock sources (<em>Pamela’s New Workout</em>, <em>ALM Busy Circuits</em>), send master clock, reset, start/stop, and other timing signals over the bridge—freeing you from unreliable DIN sync/buffered mults checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>6. Cross-Case Feedback and Reprocessing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Build elaborate feedback paths between modules in different cases.</li>
<li><strong>Modules to combine</strong>:<ul>
<li>Patch audio out through 7Path into a <em>filter, wavefolder, or wave shaper</em> in another case, then return that processed signal back for further mangling.</li>
<li>Feedback effects chains (e.g., delay or reverb patched into itself via 7Path) for experimental textures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>7. Collaborative Modular Play</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Share utilities or voices for collaborative modular jams.</li>
<li><strong>Modules to combine</strong>:<ul>
<li>Friend has a sequencer in their system, you have voices in yours—send CV/gates through the 7Path rather than long spaghetti.</li>
<li>Each player can dedicate specific 7Path lanes to trigger, modulation, or audio interchange.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Tips for Advanced Use</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethernet Cable Choice</strong>: Use <strong>shielded cables</strong> for longer runs (&gt;10ft) or when running past power cords/noisy environments.</li>
<li><strong>Bi-Directional Use</strong>: Since 7Path is passive, each lane can send or receive—get experimental with feedback, cross-modulation, or alternating control directions/performance setups.</li>
<li><strong>Color Coding</strong>: Use colored patch cables into the 7Path to keep track of what patch point goes where in distant racks.</li>

<h1>Creative Ways to Use 2hp Pitch in Your Modular System</h1>
<p>The 2hp Pitch is a compact, time-domain pitch shifter with integrated wow &amp; flutter for authentically “wobbly” tape and vinyl-like pitch modulation. Below are some inventive patch ideas and module combinations to maximize its potential in your Eurorack system:</p>
<h2>1. Faux Dual Oscillator (VCO Pairing)</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Use the Pitch module after a basic VCO (analog or digital) to easily achieve dual-oscillator timbres, stacked harmonies, or dense mono/poly textures without a second VCO.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Patch your primary VCO into 2hp Pitch (audio in).
- Pitch-shift the output up/down by a set interval (fifth, octave, etc.) with CV or the pitch knob.
- Mix this with the VCO's dry output using a mixer, or blend the dry/wet on Pitch itself.
- Heavy wow &amp; flutter can simulate “drift” in one oscillator—perfect for classic synth warmth.
- <strong>Example Modules:</strong> Make Noise STO, Intellijel Dixie II+, Mutable Instruments Plaits.</p>

<h2>2. Harmonic &amp; Timbral Processing (Waveshapers/Folders)</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Send pitch-shifted audio into a waveshaper/wavefolder or filter for unique harmonic results. Pitch shifting introduces new intervals and overtones that react in dramatic and unexpected ways to further processing.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Audio Source → 2hp Pitch (subtle or extreme shift) → Wavefolder (e.g., Befaco Chopping Kinky) or Filter (e.g., Ripples).
- Modulate the Pitch's wow &amp; flutter for animated, organic sonic movement—especially good for drones or pads.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Creating Lush Textures (Reverb/Delay/Looper)</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Add “tape machine” character to reverbs, delays, and loopers by pitching and fluttering the input or output. Great for generative ambient, lush sound beds, and pseudo-tape warble.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Place 2hp Pitch before or after a looper (e.g., 2hp Loop, Mutable Instruments Clouds for granular looping).
- For shimmer-style effects, run reverberated audio back into 2hp Pitch and blend octaves.
- Modulate wow &amp; flutter for deep tape echo feel (send short “tape” repeats to delay, e.g. Make Noise Mimeophon or Erica Synths Pico DSP).</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. Glitchy Percussion Reshaping</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Transform drum loops or one-shots (from a sample player or drum module) with extreme pitch shifting or modulated wow &amp; flutter, producing glitch, IDM, and experimental textures.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Sample Source/Drum Machine → 2hp Pitch (modulate wildly with stepped random, sample &amp; hold, or sequencer CV) → output.
- Combine with a drum filter or stutter module to accentuate lo-fi, chopped flavors.
- <strong>Example:</strong> Patch the W&amp;F CV input with an LFO, S&amp;H, or random source (e.g., Mutable Instruments Tides, Wogglebug).</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Animated Sequences &amp; Dynamic Melodies</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Animate pitch shifts via sequencer or CV for evolving riffs and melodies, or create harmonic counterpoint with arpeggiated lines.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Use a pitch CV/Gate sequencer (e.g., Arturia Keystep, Malekko Varigate) to modulate both your VCO and the Pitch's 1V/oct input. Offset or invert one of the sequences for rich counterpoint.
- Animate the Mix CV input for morphing between dry and wet signals in real time, using a synced envelope or LFO for dynamic movement.</p>
<hr />
<h2>6. Lo-Fi Freeze and Harmonic Freezing</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Pair with 2hp Freez or another looper/stutter module for sound design. Freeze slices of heavily pitch-shifted and fluttered audio for evolving lo-fi pads and textures.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Chain: VCO or Noise &gt; Pitch (max wow/flutter) &gt; Freez &gt; Reverb/texture FX.
- Modulate both modules' parameters for a range from mild tape shimmer to total glitch meltdown.</p>
<hr />
<h2>7. Stereo Widening/Detune Techniques</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br />
Send a dry signal to one channel and the pitch-shifted, fluttered signal to another for instant stereo wideness and animation—excellent for thick basses, leads, or synth layers.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
- Use a mult or buffered splitter.
- L ↔ dry, R ↔ wet (pitch up, wow/flutter modulated).
- Pan hard left/right for classic chorus, or modulate pitch for extra width.</p>

<h2>General Module Type Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>VCOs</strong> (any flavor) for harmonic stacking</li>
<li><strong>Mixers/Crossfaders</strong> for dry/wet blending (e.g., Happy Nerding PanMix, Doepfer A-138)</li>
<li><strong>Loopers/Granular Samplers</strong> (Mutable Clouds, 2hp Loop)</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Generators/LFOs/Random</strong> (modulate Pitch/W&amp;F CV)</li>
<li><strong>Delays/Reverbs</strong> for ambient tails</li>
<li><strong>Drum Machines/Samplers</strong> for unpredictable percussion</li>
<li><strong>Wavefolders/Filters/DISTORTION</strong> for sculpting shifted tones</li>
</ul>

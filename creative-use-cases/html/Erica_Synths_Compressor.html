<h2>Creative Patch Ideas for Erica Synths Stereo Compressor</h2>
<p>The <strong>Erica Synths Stereo Compressor</strong> offers powerful dynamic control for your modular system, especially for percussion and rhythmic elements. Here are several creative ways you can use this module in your Eurorack system:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Bus Compression for Modular Drum Mixes</strong></h3>
<p>Send multiple drum modules or a summed percussion mix to the Stereo Compressor’s inputs. Use the <strong>Stereo Link</strong> for both channels to lock the dynamics together, gluing your drum bus and providing a tighter, punchier feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Pairings:</strong> Erica Synths Drum Series Modules (Kick, Snare, Toms, etc.), WMD Chimera, Mutable Instruments Peaks, or Tiptop Audio 909/808 modules.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Sidechain Pumping for Rhythmic Movement</strong></h3>
<p>Use the <strong>sidechain input</strong> to trigger the compressor from a sync’d kick drum, bass, or any rhythmic source. This classic dance/techno/house effect will make pads, basslines, or even complete mixes "duck" in time with the sidechain signal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example Patch:</strong> Kick drum output → Sidechain Input; Bass/Pad/Full Mix → Compressor Audio Input → Mixer/Output.</li>
<li><strong>Recommended Modules:</strong> Mutable Instruments Plaits (for pads), Intellijel Atlantis, Make Noise STO (for bass), with a drum module such as Erica Synths Bass Drum as the sidechain source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Animated Stereo Effects With Hard-Panned Signals</strong></h3>
<p>Feed two different rhythmic or melodic signals into the left and right inputs. With <strong>Stereo Link</strong> off, the compressor responds separately to each channel, creating dynamic, shifting stereo effects—especially if the activity and loudness differ between channels.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Pairings:</strong> Two sequenced voices; E.g., Befaco Even VCO panned left, Mutable Instruments Rings panned right.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Voltage-Controlled Compression With External Modulation</strong></h3>
<p>Not strictly advertised, but you can creatively use VCAs and mixers to modulate the input or sidechain, allowing CV control over compression response. Try patching an LFO or sequencer into a mixer with the sidechain source to dynamically sculpt pumping effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Modules:</strong> Befaco A*B+C, Intellijel Quad VCA, ALM Pamela’s New Workout (for rhythmic CV).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Parallel Compression (‘New York Compression’)</strong></h3>
<p>Split your dry signal: one part goes directly to the output/mixer, the other through the compressor. Mix the compressed and dry signals for enhanced punch and subtle saturation while retaining the original transients.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Modules:</strong> Mutable Instruments Shades (for mixing), Make Noise X-PAN, Happy Nerding 3x MIA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Drum Bus (Multiband/Split Frequency) Compression</strong></h3>
<p>Use a crossover or filter bank to split your drums into high and low frequency bands. Compress only one band (e.g., just the lows for kick/bass), then recombine for maximally tailored groove and punch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Modules:</strong> Worng SoundStage, Frap Tools CUNSA, Mutable Instruments Blades or Shelves as a simple crossover.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. <strong>Stereo Widening &amp; Animation</strong></h3>
<p>Feed two similar, slightly different percussion sources (or stereo feeds with small variances) and experiment with extreme settings or subtle compression alongside <strong>Stereo Link</strong> to play with perceived stereo width and movement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Modules:</strong> 4ms Pingable Envelope Generator (for rhythmic pings), Xaoc Devices Zadar for LFO-driven sound sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pro Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>VU meter</strong> to visually dial in perfect levels—ideal for live performance!</li>
<li><strong>Sidechain outputs</strong> act as buffered copies of the input. These can be sent to additional processing, e.g., envelope followers, analyzers, or more compression!</li>
<li>Extreme <strong>compression ratios</strong> (∞:1) can creatively "gate" or "limit" parts for brutal noise/industrial effects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Explore and experiment—the Erica Synths Stereo Compressor is more than just a utility; it’s a creative instrument for sculpting the dynamic foundation of your modular mixes!</p>

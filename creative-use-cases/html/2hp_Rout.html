<h1>Creative Patch Ideas for 2hp Rout</h1>
<p>The 2hp Rout is a compact, voltage-controlled gate switch, offering dynamic routing of a single gate/trigger input to any of four outputs. Here’s how you can creatively integrate it into your modular system:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Rhythmic Pattern Distribution</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Sequencer (e.g., <strong>Make Noise Rene</strong>, <strong>Intellijel Metropolix</strong>)<br />
- Drum modules (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.)<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Feed a single rhythmic gate pattern from your sequencer or clock divider into Rout’s INPUT. Use a CV sequencer, random source, or any modulation source patched to SEL CV to dynamically select which drum voice receives the gate at any moment. This creates constantly evolving drum patterns from a single sequence.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Generative Percussion Shuffling</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Random CV generator (e.g., <strong>Make Noise Wogglebug</strong>, <strong>Mutable Instruments Marbles</strong>)<br />
- Drum voices or sound sources<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Send random stepped CV to Rout's SEL CV, and the master clock to INPUT. Each clock pulse triggers a different drum or percussion voice, scrambling the groove for generative rhythms.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Voice Allocation for Shared Gate Patterns</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Polyphonic voice modules or several mono synths<br />
- Quantizer<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Send an arpeggiator or rhythmic gate sequence to INPUT. Use manual SEL or CV-controlled SEL for live or sequenced voice allocation, letting a single pattern "jump" between different voices or timbres for evolving melodic lines.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>Accent Routing</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- CV sequence (accent pattern)<br />
- Drum module/sound source with accent in<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Feed a main clock or trigger into Rout’s INPUT, and use SEL CV (patterned with accents) to choose when to send triggers to an accent input, opening up full/partial accents depending on SEL position.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. <strong>Performance-Based Output Switching</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Manual offset generator (e.g., <strong>Intellijel Planar</strong>, <strong>Doepfer A-174-2 Joystick</strong>)<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Use Rout as a manual performance router by controlling SEL with a joystick or offset knob. This allows "live switching" of gate outputs to different voices on the fly.</p>
<hr />
<h2>6. <strong>Step-by-Step Gate Distribution from Sequencer</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Multi-channel step sequencer<br />
- Four different drum modules or effect triggers<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Use a CV sequencer channel mapped to 0–5V to step through outputs in sync with your gate pattern. Rout distributes the main trigger sequence in a linear or custom sequence across four destinations.</p>
<hr />
<h2>7. <strong>Probability-Based Routing</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Probability gate module (e.g., <strong>Mutable Instruments Branches</strong>)<br />
- Random CV source<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Combine a probability gate and a random CV source to occasionally switch Rout’s outputs based on probability thresholds, making some drums or events less or more likely depending on performance context.</p>
<hr />
<h2>8. <strong>Layered Effects or Fill Switches</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Modules Needed:</strong><br />
- Effect modules with gate/trig input (e.g., gating a delay/reverb)<br />
- Drum fill trigger source<br />
<strong>Patch Idea:</strong><br />
Send your groove’s "fill" trigger to Rout INPUT. SEL CV determines which effect or fill gets engaged, making fills less predictable and effects timbrally varied.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Tips for Best Results</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequence SEL with quantized CV sources</strong> to ensure neat output changes.</li>
<li><strong>Stack Rout with other sequential switches</strong> for more complex routing hierarchies.</li>
<li><strong>Use LEDs as indicators</strong> when patching live: the Rout’s out LEDs are helpful for visual troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>By using Rout for gate/trigger signal routing under voltage control, you can bring order, chaos, or new complexity to your rack’s rhythm and event structure.</p>

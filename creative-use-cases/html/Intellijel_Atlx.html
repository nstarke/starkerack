<h1>Creative Uses for the <strong>Atlx Expander</strong> with Other Eurorack Modules</h1>
<p>The <strong>Atlx Expander</strong> supercharges your <strong>Atlantix</strong> voice by breaking out dedicated waveform and filter outputs, plus a ring modulator. This opens up a host of unique patching possibilities within your system—here are some creative ways to exploit its expanded I/O:</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Parallel Waveform Mixing and Layering</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Outputs:</strong> Take the <em>sine</em>, <em>triangle</em>, <em>saw</em>, and <em>square</em> outs individually.</li>
<li><strong>Mixer Module:</strong> Use a mixer (e.g., Intellijel Mixup, Mutable Veils, ALM Tangle Quartet) to combine several waveforms from Oscillator A and/or B. </li>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Achieve custom complex waves, crossfades, or send blends to different destinations (parallel processing).</li>
<li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Modulate levels with VCAs for wave morphing or evolve timbres under CV control.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Creative Filter Routing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lowpass, Bandpass, Highpass, Phazor outs:</strong> Route different filter outs to separate destinations.</li>
<li><strong>Spatialization:</strong> Send each filtered stream to a different stereo channel (using a stereo mixer or panning module like Happy Nerding PanMix).</li>
<li><strong>Effects Processing:</strong> Send the phazor out to a delay/reverb (e.g., Make Noise Mimeophon, Strymon Magneto) for lush phase-washed textures while keeping the dry outs for punchy clarity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Self-Patching Mayhem</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audio-Rate FM:</strong> Patch a waveform out from oscillator A/B into any CV input of the filter or VCO for audio-rate frequency modulation.</li>
<li><strong>Filter Feedback:</strong> Use a spare filter out (e.g., highpass) and patch it back into the Atlantix's audio input, or FM input, for overdriven, chaotic textures.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Following:</strong> Use something like Mutable Instruments Ears or Befaco Envelope Follower on a filter out for dynamic CV derived from your patch.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>Ring Modulation Explorations</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch two disparate sources</strong> to X and Y inputs (e.g., any waveforms, external audio, or modulation signals).</li>
<li><strong>Destination Ideas:</strong> </li>
<li><em>Ring Out</em> into effects (distortion, reverb).</li>
<li><em>Ring Out</em> used as a carrier for a vocoder or spectral processor (e.g., Make Noise Spectraphon).</li>
<li><em>Ring Out</em> used for crazy percussion when combined with short, dynamic envelopes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. <strong>Sub Oscillator Basslines</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub Square (A only):</strong> Patch independently for thick sub bass while using main A/B oscillators for mid/high content.</li>
<li><strong>Split Across Effects:</strong> Process the sub square through a lowpass filter and the main voices through distortion or waveshaping for clean, focused low end and wild tops.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. <strong>Parallel Modulation</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Dedicated Outs:</strong> Send triangle from A to modulate a filter, square from B to clock a sequencer (such as Pamela's Pro Workout), or any other combination for unique rhythmic interaction.</li>
<li><strong>VCAs as Waveshapers:</strong> Route wave outs into a VCA with fast envelopes for dynamic, percussive tones.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>7. <strong>Cross-Module Integration</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Recommended Types/Modules:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wavefolders (e.g., Intellijel Bifold, Serge Wave Multiplier):</strong> Process raw sine or tri outs for rich harmonics.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Oscillators:</strong> Feed filter or ring mod out into another oscillator's FM input for evolving timbres.</li>
<li><strong>Quad Envelope or LFO (Intellijel Quadrax, Maths):</strong> Animate mixer levels or filter CVs for morphing, organic results.</li>
<li><strong>Samplers/Loopers (4ms Stereo Triggered Sampler):</strong> Capture the various outs for later reprocessing/triggering.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
<p>The Atlx expands the routing creativity of your Atlantix dramatically. By using mixers, VCAs, wavefolders, spatial processors, and utilities, you can turn it into a centerpiece of a constantly morphing modular patch.</p>

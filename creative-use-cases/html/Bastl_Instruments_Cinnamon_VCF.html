<h1>Creative Patch Ideas for Bastl Cinnamon in Your Eurorack System</h1>
<p>The <strong>Bastl Cinnamon</strong> is a highly characterful and flexible state-variable filter, perfect for pushing into creative sound design territory. Here are several ways you can integrate it with other Eurorack modules for inspiring results:</p>
<h2>1. <strong>Oscillator Mode Exploration</strong></h2>
<p>Cinnamon can self-oscillate and yields different sine-like, saw-like, and edgy waveforms via its <strong>Character switches</strong>.<br />
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Quantizer module</strong> (e.g., Tiptop Audio Quantizer, Doepfer A-156): Patch Cinnamon's self-oscillating output into a quantizer for filtered melodies that track 1V/oct when Character is off.
- <strong>Envelope generator</strong> (e.g., Make Noise Maths, Intellijel Quadrax): Modulate cutoff to add vibrato or filter sweeps to your "oscillator."
- <strong>Waveshaper/distortion</strong> (e.g., Mutable Instruments Warps): To further sculpt unique tones from the self-oscillation output.</p>
<h2>2. <strong>Character Morphing FX Filter</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Character switches</strong> drastically change the resonance behavior—you can automate them for live performance FX.
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Manual gate/sequential switch</strong> (e.g., Doepfer A-150, Mutable Instruments Branches): Trigger the switch positions using gates for dynamic filter timbre shifting during a sequence.
- <strong>Envelope follower</strong> (e.g., Endorphin.es Airstreamer, Doepfer A-119): Extract dynamics from a drum loop to automate Character switches or CV cutoff for responsive filtering.</p>
<h2>3. <strong>Dual CV Cutoff Animation</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Right CV</strong> can be deeply attenuated, while the <strong>Left CV</strong> offers predictable pitch tracking.
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Dual LFO</strong> (e.g., XAOC Batumi, Befaco Rampage): Animate both the Left and Right CV with different shapes and speeds for rich, morphing filter movement.
- <strong>Random/chaos CV source</strong> (e.g., Make Noise Wogglebug, Mutable Marbles): Inject randomness into one CV input for organic evolving sweeps.</p>
<h2>4. <strong>Drive + Feedback Distortion</strong></h2>
<p>With the <strong>Drive switch</strong>, you can easily push the input into rich distortion.
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Audio rate oscillator</strong> (e.g., classic VCO/complex oscillator): Run through Cinnamon with Drive enabled for overdriven tones.
- <strong>Audio feedback path</strong> (patch HP or BP out back into its own input, maybe via an attenuator like ALM S.B.G or Mutable Shades): Creates wild, self-modulating soundscapes.</p>
<h2>5. <strong>Multi-pass Filtering and Crossfading</strong></h2>
<p>With simultaneous <strong>low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass outputs</strong>, use Cinnamon as a <strong>multiband signal splitter</strong>.
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Crossfader/matrix mixer</strong> (e.g., Happy Nerding 3xMIA, Intellijel Triatt): Blend LP, BP, and HP outs dynamically for unique filter morphs.
- <strong>Multi-effects system</strong> (e.g., Mutable Instruments Clouds, Make Noise Mimeophon): Send different filter outs to different effects, then recombine or pan separately.</p>
<h2>6. <strong>Creative Percussive Sound Design</strong></h2>
<p>Push an envelope or fast LFO into cutoff, especially in BP/HP modes, for snappy percussive sounds.
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Envelope generator/sequenced gates</strong>: Use fast AD envelopes to "ping" Cinnamon for organic percussive blips (try Make Noise Maths, ALM Pip Slope).
- <strong>Noise generator or sample playback</strong>: Filter noise or pitch-quantized samples to create lo-fi percussion.</p>
<h2>7. <strong>Voltage-Controlled Filter Processing for External Instruments</strong></h2>
<p>Use the input gain and drive controls to heat up and filter <em>any</em> line-level or modular-level audio—guitar, drum machines, DAW sends, etc.
<strong>Combine with:</strong><br />
- <strong>Input interface</strong> (e.g., Intellijel Audio Interface II): Properly boost and impedance-match external gear for smooth integration.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Remember that extreme Character modes may disrupt proper 1V/oct tracking—a feature you can exploit intentionally for organic instability in sequence and drone patches!</p>

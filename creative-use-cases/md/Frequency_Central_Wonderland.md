# Creative Uses for Wonderland in Eurorack

The Frequency Central Wonderland is a powerful 8x8 patchbay/matrix mixer/switcher, offering versatile routing, switching, phase inversion, and micro-attenuation. Here are several creative ways to utilize Wonderland in your Eurorack system, along with suggested pairings for enhanced results.

---

## 1. **Voltage Controlled Routing and Performance Switching**
- **Combo Modules:** Add a sequential switch (e.g., Doepfer A-151, 4MS Shuffling Clock Multiplier) or logic modules (e.g., Mutable Instruments Kinks) to dynamically route signals during a performance.
- **Creative Use:** Route multiple voices or modulation sources and instantly reconfigure signal paths live by engaging different switches, creating complex evolving patches. Use footswitches or external tactile triggers for hands-on switching.

---

## 2. **Matrix Feedback Networks**
- **Combo Modules:** Use with effects modules (e.g., Make Noise Mimeophon, Mutable Instruments Beads, Erica Synths Fusion Delay) and VCAs (e.g., Intellijel Quad VCA).
- **Creative Use:** Patch outputs from Wonderland to effects, then feed the processed signals back into available matrix inputs. With micro-attenuators, precisely control the feedback depth per path, great for self-oscillating drones, Karplus-Strong synthesis, or generative textures.

---

## 3. **Multi-Bus Audio Distribution and Summing**
- **Combo Modules:** Distribute audio from drum machines (e.g., Tiptop Audio BD808/909), drum voices, or oscillators to multiple destinations like filters and wavefolders (e.g., Mutable Instruments Ripples, Intellijel Bifold).
- **Creative Use:** With one input feeding several outputs add per-output phase inversion to create stereo width or phase-canceling textures. Use different micro-attenuator amounts on each path for subtle panning, mixing, or “mults with attitude”.

---

## 4. **Complex Modulation Routing**
- **Combo Modules:** Pair with LFOs (e.g., Xaoc Devices Batumi), ADSRs (e.g., Doepfer A-140), or random sources (e.g., Make Noise Wogglebug).
- **Creative Use:** Send multiple modulation sources to multiple destinations, from filter cutoff to wavefolder symmetry. Route an LFO to several parameters, but with micro-attenuators controlling modulation depth per parameter. Instant reconfiguration without re-patching.

---

## 5. **Invert and Compare CVs or Audio**
- **Combo Modules:** Utilize comparators or logic modules (e.g., Doepfer A-166 Dual Logic Module, Mutable Instruments Branches) with the inverted outputs.
- **Creative Use:** With inverted outputs, create pseudo ring-mod, phase cancellation, or use the inverted CV for bipolar modulation (e.g., use positive LFO on one destination, negative LFO on another). This greatly increases modulation and mixing creativity.

---

## 6. **Matrix-Controlled Drum Mixer**
- **Combo Modules:** Integrate with drum voice modules (e.g., Hexinverter Mutant Bassdrum, ALM Akemies Taiko) and output VCAs/mixers.
- **Creative Use:** Route and mix drum voices to multiple group busses simultaneously or send single drum sources to several effects in parallel. Use the momentary/latching matrix to mute, solo, or blend on the fly.

---

## 7. **Intermodulation and Audio Mangling**
- **Combo Modules:** CSU (Complex Signal Utility) modules, wavefolders, distortion units. Try routing multiple oscillators into one output, adjusting mixes for subharmonic, clangorous, or clipped tones.
- **Creative Use:** Use Wonderland’s micro-attenuators to blend several signals into one "super" mixer, intentionally overloading an output for crazy distortion, or keeping levels controlled for lush polyphony.

---

## 8. **Patch Memory and Fast Reconfiguration**
- **Combo Modules:** Put Wonderland adjacent to a multi-effect unit (e.g., FX Aid), or sampler module (e.g., 4MS Stereo Triggered Sampler).
- **Creative Use:** Instantly re-route sampled content to effects or processing chains, or switch sampling/or playback sources without unplugging cables. Useful in live shows for rapidly shifting between sonic palettes.

---

## Bonus: **Expand Wonderland’s Control**
- **Expansion Ideas:** Use motorized or digitally actuated pushbuttons (DIY or modular) for programmable scene/preset recall. Or interface push switches to trigger events in software (via CV to MIDI or Gates-to-USB modules).

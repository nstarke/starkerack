# Creative Patch Ideas for SSF Autodyne  
*(Eurorack Modular Synthesizer Context)*

The **Steady State Fate Autodyne** is a compact (4hp) analog auto-compressor/distortion with a multi-mode sidechain filter and blend control for NY (parallel) compression. Its controls are especially streamlined for both subtle and extreme dynamics shaping, making it versatile for creative synthesis.

Below are creative use-cases and patch ideas that combine **Autodyne** with other Eurorack modules for unique results:

---

## 1. Drum Bus "Glue" and Sidechain Pumping
- **Patch:** Route your kick, snare, and hats submix (via a mixer like Intellijel Mixup or Doepfer A-138) into Autodyne.
- **Creative addition:** Feed your kick drum’s trigger into the external Sidechain Input—bandpass or highpass the trigger via a module like Mutable Instruments Ripples for more sculpted sidechaining.
- **Result:** This allows Autodyne to "pump" your loop with every kick, classic in electronic/house genres.

---

## 2. Add Grit & Character to Synth Voices
- **Patch:** Insert Autodyne after a melodic synth voice (e.g., Make Noise STO → Mutable Instruments Ripples → Autodyne).
- **Creative addition:** Crank the COMP and GAIN for saturated, aggressive tones; use BLEND to finesse parallel crunch.
- **Result:** Fattens up basses or leads; the blend lets you keep dynamics controlled but still present.

---

## 3. Voltage-Controlled Compression Jams
- **Patch:** Use a VCA (e.g., Intellijel Quad VCA) _before_ Autodyne, modulated by a sequencer or random source (e.g., Make Noise Maths or Wogglebug).
- **Creative addition:** Modulate the VCA with envelopes/LFOs—dynamic changes into Autodyne will yield interactive compression sounds.
- **Result:** Compression reacts dynamically, creating rhythmic "grooves" even with static source material.

---

## 4. Parallel Drum Buss Shaping
- **Patch:** Split a drum loop via a mult or mixer send: one path dry, one through Autodyne. Re-combine with a second mixer and adjust blend.
- **Creative addition:** Use modular effect send/return (like WMD Overseer or Befaco Hexmix VCF for filtering the compressed path before recombining).
- **Result:** Classic NY "smash and blend" drum sound, with creative modular filtering possible.

---

## 5. Experimental Sidechain Sources
- **Patch:** Use a synced LFO, envelope follower (Intellijel Envelopes), or audio-rate oscillator to drive the sidechain input.
- **Creative addition:** Highpass filter the sidechain source for spectral emphasis.
- **Result:** Get rhythmic or audio-rate "chop" compression for glitch, gating, or dynamic filtering textures.

---

## 6. Stereo Operation
- **Patch:** Use two Autodynes on a stereo pair (e.g., Erica Synths Black Stereo Mixer), matching controls for dual-mono stereo compression.
- **Result:** Wide, dynamic stereo compression/glue for whole mixes or stereo synths.

---

## 7. Creative Distortion and Feedback
- **Patch:** Patch Autodyne output back into its own input via an attenuator/VCA (careful with gain/levels!).
- **Creative addition:** Insert a wavefolder or ring modulator in the feedback path.
- **Result:** Self-oscillation and dense, gnarly distortion textures.

---

## Useful Module Combinations

- **Filter before/after:** For additional tone shaping (Doepfer A-124 WASP, Rossum Morpheus)
- **Envelope generator in sidechain:** Shapes when/how compression kicks in (Intellijel Quadrax, Maths)
- **Send/Return mixer:** Integrate parallel effects easily (Befaco Hexmix, WMD Overseer)
- **Random/chaos:** Use whimsical CV for sidechain for unpredictable musical movement (Mutable Instruments Marbles, Make Noise Wogglebug)

Explore these patch tactics and blend your favorite voices, drums, or even external gear through Autodyne! Its compact format and powerful features open up advanced, mix-level dynamics shaping that’s rare in modular.

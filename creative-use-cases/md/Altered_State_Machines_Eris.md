## Creative Uses for the Eris 4x4 Matrix Mixer in a Modular Synthesizer System

The **Altered State Machines Eris** 4x4 matrix mixer offers a wealth of creative patching possibilities thanks to its unique routing, DC coupling, and CV/audio capabilities. Here are some advanced and interesting ways you might use the Eris in your setup, along with relevant module recommendations:

---

### 1. Multi-FX Send/Return Matrix

**How-To:**  
- Connect your primary oscillator(s) or voice(s) to the Eris inputs.
- Send the 4 outputs to four different effects modules (e.g., **Make Noise Mimeophon, Mutable Instruments Beads, Strymon Magneto, or Erica Synths Fusion Delay**).
- Return the effects' outputs to another mixer, or back to Eris’s Aux In.
- Use the matrix to blend dry/wet effects, create parallel processing chains, or even feedback mixes by routing effect outputs back to Eris inputs.

**Result:**  
Complex, evolving textures and chained effects mixes—highly customizable send/return routing usually found in high-end consoles.

---

### 2. Feedback and No-Input Mixing

**How-To:**  
- Patch Eris's outputs back into its own inputs to create a "no-input" mixer situation.
- Insert filters (e.g., **Doepfer A-124 Wasp Filter**), distortion units, or delays in between the feedback loops.

**Result:**  
Self-generating drones, complex feedback tones, and experimental soundscapes reminiscent of old analog mixers used as sound sources.

---

### 3. CV Routing and Cross-Modulation Matrix

**How-To:**  
- Send up to four modulation sources (e.g., **ALM Pamela’s Pro Workout, Make Noise Maths, Mutable Instruments Stages**) into Eris inputs.
- Route and attenuate blends of these CV signals to four different destinations (oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, VCA, etc).

**Result:**  
Highly dynamic, interwoven modulations, perfect for generative patches or animated sound design.

---

### 4. Polyrhythmic Drum/Trigger Matrix

**How-To:**  
- Route triggers/gates from different sequencers (e.g., **Intellijel Metropolix, 4ms Quad Clock Distributor**) or drum machines into Eris.
- Send blended, attenuated, or even overdriven signals to trigger/clock various drum voices (e.g., **Noise Engineering Basimilus Iteritas Alter, Mutable Instruments Peaks**).

**Result:**  
Create composite or probability-based rhythms, hybrid percussion triggers, and morphing drum patterns.

---

### 5. Audio-to-CV Distortion/Mangling

**How-To:**  
- Use Eris as a waveshaping signal processor for CV (by running LFOs/envelopes hot into x4 gain), or for overdriving and distorting audio.
- Route the distorted output into envelope followers (**Doepfer A-119**, **Mutable Instruments Ears**) for dynamic CV generation.

**Result:**  
Responsive, highly distorted CV or audio signals that can turn subtle modulation into wild shapes or drive filters/VCAs unusually.

---

### 6. Performance Mixer with Mutes

**How-To:**  
- Use the aux channel and vactrol-based soft mute to bring in external gear, sidechain signals, or live input (vocal mic, external synth).
- Gently fade in/out sections or transitions live without clicks or pops.

**Result:**  
A tactile, smooth-performance mixer solution for hands-on sets.

---

### 7. Cybernetic/Compounded Feedback Networks

**How-To:**  
- Integrate the Eris within a feedback chain; outputs from delays, reverbs (e.g., **Strymon Magneto**, **Tiptop Z-DSP**) are routed back into the mixer.
- Use the Eris gain stages to control the amount and type of feedback precisely.

**Result:**  
Self-generating pads, endlessly evolving atmospheres, and new "instruments" created from feedback.

## Generic Module Type Suggestions

- **Complex Oscillators:** Route different waves into/out of Eris for FM/AM mixes.
- **Function Generators (Maths, Function, Rampage):** For evolving CV blends.
- **Envelope Followers, VCAs, or Ring Modulators:** For processing and shaping signals further.
- **Sequencers & Logic Modules:** For creative CV/gate mixing.

---

### **Bonus Patching Tips**

- Flip the back panel switch for x2 gain on the Aux input and creatively overdrive external synths, drum machines, or microphones.
- Use Eris as a pseudo-quadraphonic distributor, sending audio or CV to different speakers/effects chains.
- Can serve as a preset morph system: carefully set up the matrix, and with minimal knob tweaks, shift between drastically different patch routings.

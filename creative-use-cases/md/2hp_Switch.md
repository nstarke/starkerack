# Creative Patch Ideas for 2hp Switch (Voltage-Controlled Router)

The **2hp Switch** is a compact, voltage-controlled four-way router for audio, CV, or gate signals—allowing either manual or CV selection of the active input. Its ability to dynamically steer between sources makes it incredibly versatile in a modular setup. Below are several patch ideas and module pairings to maximize its creative potential:

---

## 1. **Morphing Modulation Sources**
- **Patch Idea:** Route four different LFOs or envelopes (from modules like Make Noise Maths, Intellijel Quadra, or Doepfer A-147) into the four Switch inputs, and send the output to a filter cutoff or oscillator pitch CV.
- **Enhancement:** Use a sequencer or random CV generator (like Mutable Instruments Marbles or Make Noise Wogglebug) into the SEL CV input to automate source selection.
- **Result:** Rhythmic or unpredictable changes in modulation, evolving over time or on command.

---

## 2. **Automated Audio Source Selection**
- **Patch Idea:** Route various oscillators, noise sources, or processed sound textures (from voices like Mutable Instruments Plaits, Noise Engineering Basimilus, etc.) into Switch.
- **Enhancement:** Send the output to effects or straight to the mixer. Use a clock divider or step sequencer to control the SEL CV for automated rhythm-based switching.
- **Result:** Quickly alternate between timbrally contrasting sound sources for glitchy, chopped, or morphing timbres in a performance or recording.

---

## 3. **Step-Addressable Gate or Trigger Router**
- **Patch Idea:** Patch four different rhythmic trigger sources (e.g., Euclidean Circles, Pamela’s New Workout, or the Erica Pico Trigger) into Switch.
- **Usage:** Use the SEL CV to select which pattern or rhythm passes through to a drum module or envelope generator.
- **Result:** Evolving drum patterns or stochastic rhythms, with the SEL knob or CV dictating rhythm flow.

---

## 4. **Voltage-Controlled Signal Selector in Feedback/FX Loops**
- **Patch Idea:** Use Switch to route four different effect returns or feedback tap points (from modules like FX AID, Mimeophon, or Spring Reverb returns).
- **Enhancement:** SEL CV could come from a random or chaotic CV generator for wild, evolving FX routings.
- **Result:** Dynamic feedback system or real-time effects mangling, with quick auditioning of various processes.

---

## 5. **Preset Morphing in Live Performance**
- **Patch Idea:** Pre-patch four different parameter configurations (e.g., four filtered or wavefolded versions of one voice) and switch between them live.
- **Enhancement:** Map SEL CV to a foot pedal (via an expression pedal-to-CV module) for hands-free scene switching on stage.
- **Result:** Instantly jump between drastically different sounds or sound worlds with precise or spontaneous control.

---

## 6. **Time-Based Logical CV Routing**
- **Patch Idea:** Send four logic pattern outputs (from a module like Mutable Instruments Branches, Doepfer A-166, or Ladik S-186) into Switch.
- **Usage:** Use a sequencer or manually modulated CV to drive SEL, effectively re-routing complex CV logic based on voltage-controlled "logic presets."
- **Result:** Advanced self-generating or algorithmic patching, unlocking generative complexity.

---

## Tips & Suggestions
- Use the Switch’s **fast response time** to audio-rate modulate the SEL input for digital-esque timbral effects or aggressive wave splicing.
- Pair with sample-and-hold modules or slew limiters to smooth or step the SEL CV for predictable or stepped transitions.
- Use a quantized SEL CV (e.g., from an analog sequencer) to guarantee clean, precise selection in time with the music.

---

**Module Recommendations for Pairing:**
- Mutable Instruments Marbles (random/sequenced CV)
- Make Noise Maths (envelopes/LFOs)
- Intellijel Tetrapad (manual touch CV)
- Pamela’s New Workout (clock/gate/trigger/gen)
- XAOC Batumi (multiple synced LFOs)
- Mutable Instruments Branches (logic patterns)

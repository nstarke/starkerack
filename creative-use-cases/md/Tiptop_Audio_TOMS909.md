# Creative Ways to Use the TOMS909 in Your Eurorack System

The Tiptop Audio TOMS909 is more than just a 1:1 analog TR-909 Tom clone — its independent Low, Mid, and High tom sections with voltage control (VC) inputs for tune and accent unlock a variety of sound design possibilities. Here are some creative patch ideas and synergistic combinations with other Eurorack modules:

---

## 1. **Percussive Polyrhythms and Sequencing**
- **Use with Multi-Channel Sequencers:**  
  Patch a 3-track gate or trigger sequencer (e.g., **Intellijel Metropolix**, **Winter Modular Eloquencer**, **ALM Pamela’s Pro Workout**) to independently trigger each tom.  
  > *Tip: Use polymetric sequencing (e.g., steps per track: 5, 7, 9) to create evolving polyrhythms, letting the TOMS909 shine as more than just “straight” toms.*

- **Accent Dynamics:**  
  Use an extra sequencer channel (or accent output, as found on a **Mutable Instruments Grids**, **Vermona Random Rhythm**, or **Erica Synths Drum Sequencer**) to drive the accent CV input of each tom independently, creating dynamic fills and accents.

---

## 2. **Voltage-Controlled Melodic Toms**
- **Melodic Control via Sequencer or Keyboard:**  
  Patch a CV sequencer (e.g., **Make Noise René**, **Intellijel Steppy + CV expander**, **Tiptop Z8000**) to the VC-TUNE inputs. Though not 1V/Oct, you can create tuned “pitched percussion” patterns, pseudo-melodic tom basslines, or wild glissandos.

- **Sample & Hold / Random Pitch:**  
  Send stepped random CV (e.g., from a **Mutable Marbles** or **Doepfer A-148**) to any VC-TUNE input for each drum hit, creating randomized, arcade-style percussion.

---

## 3. **Audio-Rate FM & Timbre Mangling**
- **FM from a VCO or Other Source:**  
  Patch a sine wave (or any other waveform) from an oscillator (e.g., **Tiptop Z3000**, **Make Noise STO**, **ALM MCO**) into the VC-TUNE input for FM drum synthesis.  
  > *Result: Metallic, syncopated, or alien tom sounds depending on modulation depth and frequency!*

- **Audio-Rate Cross Modulation:**  
  Use audio-rate envelopes or even other drum sounds to modulate the VC-TUNE for insane, metallic or glitchy toms.

---

## 4. **Effects Processing Chains**
- **Send Individual Outs to FX:**  
  Patch each Tom’s output to separate channels on a stereo mixer. Add different spot effects (e.g., **Erica Synths Fusion Delay/Flanger/Vintage Ensemble**, **Noise Engineering Desmodus Versio**, **Intellijel Rainmaker**, **ALM MFX**) to each for wide, dramatic stereo images.

- **Global Bus Mix Out to Stereo FX:**  
  Mix all Toms via the MIX OUT, then process through a stereo effects chain such as ping-pong delay (**Tiptop Z-DSP with PingPong algorithm**, as in the manual), reverb (**Mutable Instruments Clouds**, **Strymon Magneto**), or frequency shifter (**Doepfer A-126-2**).

---

## 5. **CV-Controlled Drum Fills & Performance FX**
- **Manual CV Control:**  
  Use a joystick (**Intellijel Planar2**, **Doepfer A-174-2**), touch controller (**Make Noise Pressure Points**), or CV fader (**Ladik F-110**) to “play” the Tune or Accent live for expressive performance fills.

- **CV Recorder/Looper FX:**  
  Use a CV recorder or preset morphing module (**Instruō Tš-L**, **4ms SISM+PEG**) to automate dramatic changes in pitch, decay, or dynamics mid-performance.

---

## 6. **Tom Synthesizer “Deconstruction”**
- **Noisy Drum Synthesis:**  
  Use the Accent CV inputs to gate or amplitude-sequence noise bursts from the Toms.  
  Add ring modulation, bitcrushing, or wavefolding (e.g., **Intellijel μFold**, **Befaco Waveshaper**) post-tom.

- **Tomoscillator?**  
  Treat a Tom section like a weird oscillator: Sustain the decay, modulate TUNE at audio rates, feed outputs through pitch-tracking envelope followers and use as basis for synth voices or strange percussion.

---

## 7. **Hybrid Drum Sounds**
- **Layer with Digital Sample Playback:**  
  Layer the TOMS909 with samples from an **ALM Squid Salmple**, **1010music Bitbox**, or **Noise Engineering Mimetic Digitalis**. Create unique acoustic/electronic drum composites.

- **Sidechain/Envelope Follower Interactions:**  
  Use envelope followers or sidechain modules (e.g., **Mutable Instruments Ears**, **XAOC Devices Sewastopol**) to extract dynamics from the Toms and modulate synth voices, basslines, FX, or even the Toms themselves for advanced interactive patches.

---

# Bonus: Patch Inspiration

> **Patch Example:**  
> - Patch a random sequencer to each Tom’s VC-TUNE for constantly shifting “tuned drums.”  
> - Accent the Hi Tom using a Euclidean trigger pattern from Pamela’s Pro Workout.  
> - Send each Tom to a different FX pedal, pan in stereo.  
> - Use an LFO to modulate the Low Tom’s Tune for a “wobble bass” percussive effect.  
> - FM a Tom with a vocal sample chopped up and looped through a sampler’s CV-out!

The TOMS909 is best thought of not just as a drum module, but as a percussive synth voice with modular, voltage-controlled dimensions — ideal for advanced, performance-focused or generative modular rigs.

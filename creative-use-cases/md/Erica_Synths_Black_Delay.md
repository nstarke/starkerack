# Creative Patch Ideas for the Erica Synths Black Stereo Delay

The **Erica Synths Black Stereo Delay** offers deep DSP-based stereo delay processing, CV control, tape/digital modes, reverse, hold/overdub, and ping-pong features—making it more than “just a delay.” Below are creative approaches to patching this module, both generically and with references to specific modules where relevant.

## 1. **Granular Looping & Live Buffer Warping**
**Patch Concept:** Use the HOLD and ADD (overdub) to capture incoming audio (e.g., melodic phrases or percussive hits) and mutate it in real-time.

- **How-To:**  
  - Send complex source material (Mutable Instruments Plaits, Make Noise Maths-function generated envelopes, or even drums) into Stereo Delay’s L/R input.
  - Use a trigger sequencer (ALM Pamela’s New Workout, Malekko Varigate, etc.) to randomly hit the **HOLD** and **ADD** inputs, shifting in and out of ‘frozen loop’ mode and layering new material.
  - Sequence the **REVERSE** trigger with probability, flip-flopping between forward and reverse playback.
  - Modulate the delay time and feedback with an LFO (XAOC Batumi, Make Noise Maths) or random CV (Mutable Instruments Marbles).

## 2. **CV-Controlled Feedback & Karplus-Strong Synthesis**
**Patch Concept:** Self-oscillation plus feedback modulation can be tuned and "played" as a pseudo-Karplus-Strong string voice.

- **How-To:**  
  - Patch a filtered, short trigger (Makenoise Function or Maths EOR output) to the input.
  - Set the delay to a very short time (few ms, try tuning by ear or scope) and crank feedback until self-oscillation.
  - Modulate delay time with a quantized CV pitch sequence (Intellijel Scales, Ornament & Crime, or any quantizer), creating pitch sweeps or melodies.
  - The tap tempo input can clock this if you want percussive rhythms.

## 3. **Psychoacoustic Stereo Imaging**
**Patch Concept:** Use the adjustable stereo spread to create spatial and phasey stereo imaging from mono sources.

- **How-To:**  
  - Send a mono source to both L and R inputs (or just Left, leave Right unconnected), output to your mixer/monitors.
  - Use the **ADD** button in “stereo spread” mode, sweep the spread via the **TIME** knob or CV for swirling, animated stereophonics.
  - CV the dry/wet mix with an envelope follower (Doepfer A-119 or Mutable Instruments Ears) so mix responds dynamically to your playing.

## 4. **Self-Playing Rhythmic Patterns**
**Patch Concept:** Use external triggers to rhythmically punch in/out HOLD, REVERSE, and ADD modes, generating unpredictable loops and reverse delays.

- **How-To:**  
  - Patch a gate/trigger sequence (from a drum sequencer like Trigger Riot/WMD Metron, or clock dividers) to the HOLD and REVERSE inputs.
  - Patch an LFO or random gate to ADD.
  - The result is a constantly evolving, glitchy stream of forward/reverse/permuted audio—a great soundscape bed or percussion mangler.

## 5. **Dub-Style Performance FX**
**Patch Concept:** Tap tempo, feedback ‘rides’, and real-time mangling for classic dub-style echo madness.

- **How-To:**  
  - Feed a snare or vocal into delay input.
  - Use an expression pedal or CV joystick (Intellijel Tetrapad, FSRs) patched to feedback or dry/wet, for live fades and feedback stabs.
  - Manually tap or clock-synchronize delay time to your tempo.
  - Blend tape and digital modes for timbral variety.
  - Patch the return into a filter (e.g., Mutable Ripples, MS-20 clone), sweeps post-delay for deeper dub sound.

## 6. **Maximalist Rhythmic Textures**
**Patch Concept:** Create complex, polyrhythmic echoes with ping-pong mode, clocking, and stereo spread.

- **How-To:**  
  - Use two independent clocks or rhythms (Pam’s, Temps Utile) to trigger tap tempo and hold/add/reverse in rhythmic relationship (e.g., 5:4 or 3:7).
  - Set ping-pong mode, and modulate stereo spread with a slowly morphing voltage (Planar 2, Batumi quadrature).
  - Feed drums, noise bursts, or chopped audio in, and listen for beat-shifted, multidimensional results.

## 7. **Ghostly Ambient Textures**
**Patch Concept:** Transform simple tone sources into endless, evolving drones.

- **How-To:**  
  - Feed sustained synth notes or guitar to the input.
  - HOLD long buffers, overdubbing gently with new notes over time.
  - Use the REVERSE button for backwards swells.
  - Slowly modulate feedback and dry/wet for subtle movement.
  - Patch post-delay output into heavy reverb (Valhalla, Clouds, FX Aid) for galactic depth.

## **Module Type Recommendations**
- **Random Voltage Generators:** Mutable Marbles, Wogglebug for unusual modulation of delay parameters.
- **Envelope Followers:** Mutable Ears, Doepfer A-119 for dynamic delay feedback or mix CV.
- **Rhythm/Trigger Sequencers:** ALM Pamela’s, WMD Metron, Intellijel Steppy to automate button-like controls (hold, reverse, add).
- **Joysticks/Manual CV:** Planar 2, Tetrapad for performance gestures.
- **Granular/Looper FX:** Pairing with Mutable Clouds/Beads, or 4MS Dual Looping Delay for wild layered atmospheres.

# Creative Uses for the **Atlx Expander** with Other Eurorack Modules

The **Atlx Expander** supercharges your **Atlantix** voice by breaking out dedicated waveform and filter outputs, plus a ring modulator. This opens up a host of unique patching possibilities within your system—here are some creative ways to exploit its expanded I/O:

---

## 1. **Parallel Waveform Mixing and Layering**

- **Patch Outputs:** Take the *sine*, *triangle*, *saw*, and *square* outs individually.
- **Mixer Module:** Use a mixer (e.g., Intellijel Mixup, Mutable Veils, ALM Tangle Quartet) to combine several waveforms from Oscillator A and/or B. 
- **Usage:** Achieve custom complex waves, crossfades, or send blends to different destinations (parallel processing).
- **Advanced:** Modulate levels with VCAs for wave morphing or evolve timbres under CV control.

---

## 2. **Creative Filter Routing**

- **Lowpass, Bandpass, Highpass, Phazor outs:** Route different filter outs to separate destinations.
- **Spatialization:** Send each filtered stream to a different stereo channel (using a stereo mixer or panning module like Happy Nerding PanMix).
- **Effects Processing:** Send the phazor out to a delay/reverb (e.g., Make Noise Mimeophon, Strymon Magneto) for lush phase-washed textures while keeping the dry outs for punchy clarity.

---

## 3. **Self-Patching Mayhem**

- **Audio-Rate FM:** Patch a waveform out from oscillator A/B into any CV input of the filter or VCO for audio-rate frequency modulation.
- **Filter Feedback:** Use a spare filter out (e.g., highpass) and patch it back into the Atlantix's audio input, or FM input, for overdriven, chaotic textures.
- **Envelope Following:** Use something like Mutable Instruments Ears or Befaco Envelope Follower on a filter out for dynamic CV derived from your patch.

---

## 4. **Ring Modulation Explorations**

- **Patch two disparate sources** to X and Y inputs (e.g., any waveforms, external audio, or modulation signals).
- **Destination Ideas:** 
  - *Ring Out* into effects (distortion, reverb).
  - *Ring Out* used as a carrier for a vocoder or spectral processor (e.g., Make Noise Spectraphon).
  - *Ring Out* used for crazy percussion when combined with short, dynamic envelopes.

---

## 5. **Sub Oscillator Basslines**

- **Sub Square (A only):** Patch independently for thick sub bass while using main A/B oscillators for mid/high content.
- **Split Across Effects:** Process the sub square through a lowpass filter and the main voices through distortion or waveshaping for clean, focused low end and wild tops.

---

## 6. **Parallel Modulation**

- **Use Dedicated Outs:** Send triangle from A to modulate a filter, square from B to clock a sequencer (such as Pamela's Pro Workout), or any other combination for unique rhythmic interaction.
- **VCAs as Waveshapers:** Route wave outs into a VCA with fast envelopes for dynamic, percussive tones.

---

## 7. **Cross-Module Integration**

### **Recommended Types/Modules:**
- **Wavefolders (e.g., Intellijel Bifold, Serge Wave Multiplier):** Process raw sine or tri outs for rich harmonics.
- **Complex Oscillators:** Feed filter or ring mod out into another oscillator's FM input for evolving timbres.
- **Quad Envelope or LFO (Intellijel Quadrax, Maths):** Animate mixer levels or filter CVs for morphing, organic results.
- **Samplers/Loopers (4ms Stereo Triggered Sampler):** Capture the various outs for later reprocessing/triggering.

---

# **Summary**

The Atlx expands the routing creativity of your Atlantix dramatically. By using mixers, VCAs, wavefolders, spatial processors, and utilities, you can turn it into a centerpiece of a constantly morphing modular patch.

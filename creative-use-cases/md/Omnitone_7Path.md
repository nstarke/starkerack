## Creative Uses for 7Path – Ethernet Patch Cable Bridge

The **7Path** is a passive Eurorack module system that allows you to patch up to 7 signals between two different points—either within a single large case or, more likely, between two separate cases—using a standard Ethernet cable. Each input/output is a direct, point-to-point connection (1:1), and it works with any Eurorack-level signal (CV, gate, audio, triggers).

### **1. Distributed Polyphonic Patching**

- **Use Case**: If you have separate cases for voices (e.g., all oscillators in one case, modulation/sequencers in another), 7Path can streamline polyphonic sending/receiving.
- **Modules to combine**:
    - **Polyphonic MIDI-CV modules** (e.g., *Expert Sleepers FH-2*, *Doepfer A-190-5*) in one case connected to several oscillators or voices in another case.
    - Use 7Path to pipe 7 independent pitch & gate pairs for 3-voice polyphony plus modulation or aftertouch.

### **2. Ultimate Performance System Interconnect**

- **Use Case**: Connect your "studio case" to a portable/jam case without losing signal integrity or cluttering with long cables.
- **Modules to combine**:
    - A *performance controller* (e.g., *Make Noise Pressure Points*, *Intellijel Tetrapad*) in one case, patched via 7Path to sound modules/effects in the other.
    - Jam with friends whose systems sit on another table, using the 7Path to send triggers, clocks, or audio between systems.

### **3. Spatial Audio/Efx Routing**

- **Use Case**: Send multichannel audio across a room to remote effects, multi-speaker setups, or tape loops.
- **Application**:
    - Send dry signals to a *dedicated FX skiff* with one or more effect modules (e.g., *Mutable Instruments Clouds, Tiptop Z-DSP*).
    - Return wet signals back or simultaneously send clock/resets for synced effects processing.

### **4. System-Wide Modulation Bus**

- **Use Case**: Distribute global modulation sources from a “mod skiff” to multiple targets in a main rack.
- **Modules to combine**:
    - *Maths*, *LFOs*, *Random sources* (e.g., *Mutable Instruments Tides, Malekko Noise*), routed across the 7Path to modulate separate voices, VCAs, or filters in another case.
    - Centralize modulation depth and variety in one place for complex, system-wide automation.

### **5. Remote Clock/Sync Distribution**

- **Use Case**: Maintain rhythmic synchronicity across sprawling systems or for live setups.
- **Modules to combine**:
    - Clock sources (*Pamela’s New Workout*, *ALM Busy Circuits*), send master clock, reset, start/stop, and other timing signals over the bridge—freeing you from unreliable DIN sync/buffered mults checks.

### **6. Cross-Case Feedback and Reprocessing**

- **Use Case**: Build elaborate feedback paths between modules in different cases.
- **Modules to combine**:
    - Patch audio out through 7Path into a *filter, wavefolder, or wave shaper* in another case, then return that processed signal back for further mangling.
    - Feedback effects chains (e.g., delay or reverb patched into itself via 7Path) for experimental textures.

### **7. Collaborative Modular Play**

- **Use Case**: Share utilities or voices for collaborative modular jams.
- **Modules to combine**:
    - Friend has a sequencer in their system, you have voices in yours—send CV/gates through the 7Path rather than long spaghetti.
    - Each player can dedicate specific 7Path lanes to trigger, modulation, or audio interchange.

***

## **Tips for Advanced Use** 

- **Ethernet Cable Choice**: Use **shielded cables** for longer runs (>10ft) or when running past power cords/noisy environments.
- **Bi-Directional Use**: Since 7Path is passive, each lane can send or receive—get experimental with feedback, cross-modulation, or alternating control directions/performance setups.
- **Color Coding**: Use colored patch cables into the 7Path to keep track of what patch point goes where in distant racks.

# Bastl Dark Matter: Creative Eurorack Patch Ideas

The Bastl Dark Matter is a feedback-focused preamp/distortion/modification module that excels at internal and external audio feedback, saturation, and driving experimental sounds. Here are some advanced and creative patch ideas for deep integration in your modular rig:

---

## 1. **Self-Feedback Drum Smasher**

**Patch:**  
- Connect the output of a drum module (e.g., *Erica Synths Pico Drums*, *Tiptop Audio One*) to the Dark Matter **INPUT**.
- Route **X-FADE OUT** back into the **FBK IN** for internal feedback, and use the **DYNAMICS** and **DRIVE** to mash and gate the drum audio.
- Modulate **FBK CV** and **DRIVE CV** with a stepped random voltage source (e.g., *Wogglebug*, *SSSR Labs SM042*) for chaotic, evolving distortions.
  
**Result:**  
Overdriven, feedback-smashed drum textures with glitchy gating and harmonic complexity.

---

## 2. **Chaotic Synth Voice Mangler**

**Patch:**  
- Patch a traditional subtractive mono synth voice (e.g., *Doepfer A-111-5 Mini Synth*, or your favorite VCO > VCF > VCA chain) into **INPUT**.
- Insert a random or sequenced modulation source (e.g., *Make Noise Maths*, *Intellijel Quadrax*) to **TONE CV** and **DRIVE CV**.
- Feed the **X-FADE OUT** back into your synth voice’s filter input or use another external processing module.

**Result:**  
Animate simple melodies or drones with aggressive, VCA-controllable feedback artifacts and wide-ranging harmonic overtones—perfect for industrial timbres.

---

## 3. **Envelope-Followed Feedback Delays**

**Patch:**  
- Patch the **X-FADE OUT** to an audio delay module’s input (e.g., *4ms Dual Looping Delay*, *Make Noise Mimeophon*).
- Send delay output back to **EXT FBK IN** on Dark Matter.
- Use the **DYNAMICS OUT** envelope to shape the feedback amount on the delay (e.g., into delay’s feedback CV input).

**Result:**  
Delay repeats morph from clean to aggressive based on audio dynamics, producing density and movement as the input signal changes.

---

## 4. **No-Input Mixer Sound Sculptor**

**Patch:**  
- Leave **INPUT** unpatched.
- Patch **X-FADE OUT** back into **EXT FBK IN**.
- Modulate **X-FADE CV** with a slow LFO (e.g., *Mutable Instruments Tides*, *Batumi*), and tweak DRIVE/TONE/DYNAMICS manually or with additional CV.

**Result:**  
Pure feedback textures and squelchy, screeching “no-input mixer” explorations with hands-on or animated tonal shifting.

---

## 5. **Voltage-Controlled Harmonic FX**

**Patch:**  
- Use a sequencer or random voltage generator (*Intellijel Metropolix*, *Random Source Serge TKB*) to modulate **TONE CV** and **FBK CV**.
- Route a full mix or bus of multiple modules (through a mixer module) to **INPUT**.
- Use **DRIVE** and **DYNAMICS** to set the saturation and responsiveness.

**Result:**  
Voltage-controlled distortion/frequency shaping FX on anything—great for mixing a whole patch through for bus coloration or live “DJ EQ” wildness.

---

## 6. **External FX-Feedback Toolbox**

**Patch:**  
- Patch **X-FADE OUT** to an external pedal or rack FX (e.g., reverb, phaser, or delay).
- Return the FX output back into **EXT FBK IN**.
- Use the **POLARITY** switch and **FBK CV** to dynamically shape external feedback character.

**Result:**  
Continuous, hands-on-control over external device feedback loops with modular modulation possibilities.

### **Recommended Complementary Modules**

- **Random/Chaos Modules:** *Make Noise Wogglebug, Mutable Instruments Marbles*  
  → Animate unpredictable changes in feedback or tone.
- **Delays/Reverbs:** *4ms Dual Looping Delay, Strymon Magneto, Mutable Instruments Clouds*  
  → Combine atmospheric textures with hyperactive feedback.
- **VCAs/Envelopes:** *Intellijel Quad VCA, ALM Tangle Quartet*  
  → Dynamic control over feedback, especially with Dark Matter’s CV inputs/outputs.
- **LFOs/Sequencers:** *Xaoc Batumi, Intellijel Metropolix*  
  → Rhythmic movement in distortion/tone.
- **Mixers/Matrix Mixers:** *Doepfer A-138, Rebel Technology Mix 4*  
  → Route multiple feedback and modulation sources for complex feedback networks.

These creative applications let Dark Matter mutate from a rowdy drive/fuzz box into a modular performance instrument—especially when paired with clever CV and external signal routing.

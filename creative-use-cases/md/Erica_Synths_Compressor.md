## Creative Patch Ideas for Erica Synths Stereo Compressor

The **Erica Synths Stereo Compressor** offers powerful dynamic control for your modular system, especially for percussion and rhythmic elements. Here are several creative ways you can use this module in your Eurorack system:

### 1. **Bus Compression for Modular Drum Mixes**
Send multiple drum modules or a summed percussion mix to the Stereo Compressor’s inputs. Use the **Stereo Link** for both channels to lock the dynamics together, gluing your drum bus and providing a tighter, punchier feel.

- **Recommended Pairings:** Erica Synths Drum Series Modules (Kick, Snare, Toms, etc.), WMD Chimera, Mutable Instruments Peaks, or Tiptop Audio 909/808 modules.

### 2. **Sidechain Pumping for Rhythmic Movement**
Use the **sidechain input** to trigger the compressor from a sync’d kick drum, bass, or any rhythmic source. This classic dance/techno/house effect will make pads, basslines, or even complete mixes "duck" in time with the sidechain signal.

- **Example Patch:** Kick drum output → Sidechain Input; Bass/Pad/Full Mix → Compressor Audio Input → Mixer/Output.
- **Recommended Modules:** Mutable Instruments Plaits (for pads), Intellijel Atlantis, Make Noise STO (for bass), with a drum module such as Erica Synths Bass Drum as the sidechain source.

### 3. **Animated Stereo Effects With Hard-Panned Signals**
Feed two different rhythmic or melodic signals into the left and right inputs. With **Stereo Link** off, the compressor responds separately to each channel, creating dynamic, shifting stereo effects—especially if the activity and loudness differ between channels.

- **Recommended Pairings:** Two sequenced voices; E.g., Befaco Even VCO panned left, Mutable Instruments Rings panned right.

### 4. **Voltage-Controlled Compression With External Modulation**
Not strictly advertised, but you can creatively use VCAs and mixers to modulate the input or sidechain, allowing CV control over compression response. Try patching an LFO or sequencer into a mixer with the sidechain source to dynamically sculpt pumping effects.

- **Recommended Modules:** Befaco A*B+C, Intellijel Quad VCA, ALM Pamela’s New Workout (for rhythmic CV).

### 5. **Parallel Compression (‘New York Compression’)**
Split your dry signal: one part goes directly to the output/mixer, the other through the compressor. Mix the compressed and dry signals for enhanced punch and subtle saturation while retaining the original transients.

- **Recommended Modules:** Mutable Instruments Shades (for mixing), Make Noise X-PAN, Happy Nerding 3x MIA.

### 6. **Drum Bus (Multiband/Split Frequency) Compression**
Use a crossover or filter bank to split your drums into high and low frequency bands. Compress only one band (e.g., just the lows for kick/bass), then recombine for maximally tailored groove and punch.

- **Recommended Modules:** Worng SoundStage, Frap Tools CUNSA, Mutable Instruments Blades or Shelves as a simple crossover.

### 7. **Stereo Widening & Animation**
Feed two similar, slightly different percussion sources (or stereo feeds with small variances) and experiment with extreme settings or subtle compression alongside **Stereo Link** to play with perceived stereo width and movement.

- **Recommended Modules:** 4ms Pingable Envelope Generator (for rhythmic pings), Xaoc Devices Zadar for LFO-driven sound sources.

### Pro Tips

- Use the **VU meter** to visually dial in perfect levels—ideal for live performance!
- **Sidechain outputs** act as buffered copies of the input. These can be sent to additional processing, e.g., envelope followers, analyzers, or more compression!
- Extreme **compression ratios** (∞:1) can creatively "gate" or "limit" parts for brutal noise/industrial effects.

Explore and experiment—the Erica Synths Stereo Compressor is more than just a utility; it’s a creative instrument for sculpting the dynamic foundation of your modular mixes!

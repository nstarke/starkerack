# Creative Patch Ideas for ADDAC112 VC Looper & Granular Processor

The ADDAC112’s deep looper/granular architecture unlocks an immense array of creative possibilities. Below are both module-agnostic and module-specific combination ideas to push your imagination with the ADDAC112:

---

## 1. **Pre-Looper Modulation & Conditioners**

**a) Texture Shaping:**
- **Modules:** [Mutable Instruments Rings/Plaits], ADDAC200PI, Make Noise QPAS  
- **Technique:** Feed a physical modeling or formant-rich oscillator into the ADDAC112’s input. Pre-process with resonant filters, wavefolders, or phasers to produce organically shifting source material for the looper/granular engine.

**b) Dynamics Control:**
- **Modules:** [XAOC Sewastopol, WMD MSCL]  
- **Technique:** Place a compressor or envelope follower in front to control input levels and generate envelopes for syncing granular functions (e.g., grains trigger bursts or envelope-panning).

---

## 2. **CV Animation and Randomization**

**a) Granular Scatter:**
- **Modules:** [Make Noise Maths, Intellijel Quadrax, Mutable Instruments Marbles, ADDAC501 Complex Random]  
- **Technique:** Patch unique CV LFOs, S&H, or random ramps into **Grain Position**, **Size**, and **Pitch CVs**. This generates morphing, non-repeating granular clouds. You could clock random sources to a sequencer for rhythmically-tied chaos or keep things free for wild atmospheres.

**b) Evolving Looper Playback:**
- **Modules:** Any stepped sequencer, voltage memory (e.g., Turing Machine or Make Noise Pressure Points)  
- **Technique:** Step-sequence the **Looper Pitch** (V/OCT input) and/or **Loop Select** for evolving tape-machine pitch bends or “playlist” grooves. Automate **Looper direction (fwd/rev)** for call/response, tape stop, or reversing glitch effects—even sync to a rhythmic gate for ping-pong textures!

---

## 3. **Feedback, Send/Return, & External Processing**

**a) Granular FX Insert/Feedback:**
- **Modules:** [4ms Dual Looping Delay, Strymon Magneto, Mutable Instruments Clouds]  
- **Technique:** Patch the ADDAC112’s output to a delay or reverb, then bring the result back into its own input, creating a self-resampled textural feedback network. Gradually automate feedback with envelopes/LFOs on reverb/delay parameters for drones or super-complex soundscapes.

**b) Real-Time Granular on External Sources:**
- **Modules:** [Radio Music, ADDAC200 PI, any sampler or field-recording module]  
- **Technique:** Route radio, field recordings, or conversational samples into the ADDAC112 to live “granulize” unpredictable real-world audio.

---

## 4. **Live Sampling and Manipulation**

**a) On-the-Fly Resampling:**
- **Modules:** Case-integrated microphone, ADDAC800X VC Mixer, or similar  
- **Technique:** Sing, play acoustic instruments, or patch modular jams into the input, grab key moments with the **Looper** (manual/CV trigger), then instantly layer, pitch, and slice the material via granular manipulation—like an experimental version of an SP-404.

**b) Modular "DJ" Setups:**
- **Modules:** Two ADDAC112, WMD Performance Mixer, or Befaco Hexmix  
- **Technique:** Use two ADDAC112 units to capture, mangle, and blend live loops from jam sessions. Crossfade between textures or A/B sections for live set arrangements.

---

## 5. **Quantized, Harmonic Granular “Melodizers”**

**a) Granular Harmonics & Polyphony:**
- **Modules:** [Expert Sleepers Disting EX/General CV, Ornament & Crime]  
- **Technique:** Load single-note or chordal samples into multiple ADDAC112 loops. Use custom quantization scales (edit `SCALES.CFG` per manual) to lock grain pitches to microtonal or regular scales. Patch pitch CV from sequencers for melodic granular “chord clouds.”

---

## 6. **Clocked/Sync Experiments**

**a) Granular Slicing with Rhythm:**
- **Modules:** [Pamela's New Workout, Tempi, Euclidean Circles, Clock Dividers]  
- **Technique:** Use external clocks—via the looper’s clocked mode—to slice, record, and switch loops in razor-tight time with your main groove. Pair with CV sequencer to jump between slices for sampled breakbeats, minimalist time-warped percussion, or sliced melodic lines.

---

## 7. **Control Surfaces, Gestures, and Expressiveness**

**a) Manual Grain Swarms:**
- **Modules:** [Joysticks (Intellijel Tetrapad, Soundmachines LS1), Pressure Points, Touch Controllers]  
- **Technique:** Use hands-on sources for CV or gates to manually “scrub” loop positions, animate grain density, or modulate feedback and volumes for performative ambient or noise sets.

---

## Bonus: **Visual Feedback & Interactive Display**

The OLED display can be exploited for live performance or patching feedback:
- Use the waveform, input meters, and envelope shapes to visually tune and match your sources’ dynamics.
- Watch colored panning and grain visualizations for real-time understanding of what the sound engine is doing, useful for live troubleshooting and improvisation.

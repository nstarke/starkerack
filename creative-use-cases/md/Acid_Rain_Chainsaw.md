## Chainsaw Stereo Super-Oscillator: Creative Patch Ideas & Module Pairings

The Acid Rain Technology Chainsaw is a flexible, polyphonic “super-oscillator” Eurorack module designed for rich stereo sounds, morphable waveforms (saw → square), and multiple simultaneous voices. Here are some creative ways to integrate the Chainsaw into a Eurorack setup:

---

### 1. **Stereo Layered Pads and Textures**
- **Patch:** Sequence each of the three V/Oct inputs from different sequencers or random sources (e.g. Hermod, Rene, or Turing Machine for generative polyphony).
- **Process outputs L/R through a stereo reverb** (e.g., Strymon Magneto, Mutable Instruments Clouds, or FX Aid XL) to create massive, evolving pad sounds.
- **Tip:** Morph the waveform knob with slow LFOs (Befaco Rampage, Make Noise Maths) for drifting, cinematic textures.

---

### 2. **Morphing Polyphonic Lead/Bass**
- **Run Chainsaw through a filter with character,** such as the Mutable Instruments Ripples or the Rossum Morpheus, then into a VCA—for expressive synth basses/leads.
- **Patch velocity or aftertouch from a MIDI-to-CV converter** (e.g., Expert Sleepers FH-2 or Endorphin.es Shuttle Control) to the waveform CV or detune CV for expressive playability.

---

### 3. **Super-Saw Chords with Unique Chord Progressions**
- **Mult the same V/Oct source to all three inputs,** but send additional CV offsets to each for voicing triads/sevenths (via precision adder like Doepfer A-185-2).
- **Add an arpeggiator or quantizer** (Tiptop Z8000, or Ornament & Crime in Harrington 1200 mode) in the CV path for evolving polyphonic arps/chord progressions.

---

### 4. **Big Mono Bass or Leads**
- Use only one output (L or R) for a fat mono super-saw/“super-square” sound, then follow with drive/saturation such as Erica Synths Fusion VCA Waveshaper or WMD Geiger Counter.
- FM input: Add audio-rate FM from another analog or digital oscillator for highly complex, metallic, or aggressive timbres. Try cross-patching with classic VCOs like Dreadbox Oscillators or Make Noise STO.

---

### 5. **Dynamic Stereo Soundscapes**
- **Animate the detune and waveform morph CVs** with two different, unsynced LFOs (Batumi, Modcan Quad LFO) or random voltage generators for unpredictable stereo movement.
- **Far Stereo FX:** Split L/R outputs to separate effects chains (different reverbs/delays, or tape machines) for true wide, psychedelic stereo images.

---

### 6. **FM Patching for Harmonic Mayhem**
- Use the FM input for audio-rate or sub-audio modulation. Patch a drum loop or a bassline into the FM CV to create pseudo-filtered, sync-like effects synced to your groove.
- Try classic analog FM from another VCO/LFO (Dixie II+, Batumi in audio range) — Chainsaw’s FM tracks up to 2kHz and responds musically!

---

### 7. **Self-Contained Polyphonic Synth Voice**
- Pair Chainsaw with an envelope generator (Quadrax, Zadar) and a high-quality stereo VCA (Intellijel Stereo VCA, Happy Nerding PanMix) for a compact, all-in-one poly voice.
- Add ADSR/LFO modulation to detune and wave morph for evolving pads.

---

### 8. **Generative and Algorithmic Patching**
- **Utilize random or generative sources**: Feed the pitch, detune, or wave morph with stepped random voltages (Wogglebug, Marbles, Sloth) for self-playing, endlessly morphing timbres.
- Great for ambient installations or drone-style setups.

---

### 9. **Integration in Hybrid Studios**
- Send Chainsaw output into an audio interface (ES-8, ES-9, or MOTU Ultralite) for DAW recording and further processing in software.
- Control Chainsaw directly from modular sequencers or via MIDI/CV from your computer.

---

### 10. **Building "Ensemble" FX Racks**
- Pair Chainsaw’s dense stereo out with a BBD chorus (Joranalogue Delay 1, Doepfer BBD) or granular texture (Mutable Instruments Clouds, Qu-Bit Nebulae) for lush, Juno-style ensemble and endless textures.

---

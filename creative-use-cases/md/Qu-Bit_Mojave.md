# Creative Eurorack Patch Ideas for **Qu-Bit Mojave**

The Qu-Bit Mojave is a highly expressive live granular processor with stochastic and algorithmic grain control, CV and gate interaction, onboard mic, and configurable outputs. Its design is ripe for both classic granular techniques and far-out generative exploration. Here are some creative ways you can patch Mojave in a modular setup:

---

## 1. **Granular Processing of External Instruments**
- **Chain**: Guitar (with preamp) or voice (through the Mojave's mic/input) → Mojave
- **Use**: Mojave’s live buffer, with “Lock” engaged, works as a creative looper and granularizer.
- **Enhance**: Place a resonator (Mutable Instruments Rings or Qu-Bit Surface) before Mojave for textural strumming, then sculpt with grains.
- **Tip**: Use Freeze and Zone CV from a sequencer (like Make Noise René or Intellijel Metropolix) for remixing performance phrases.

## 2. **Grain Clouds as Harmonic Pads**
- **Chain**: Mojave + Polyphonic MIDI–to–CV module + Polyphonic Oscillator (Qu-Bit Chord v2, Mutable Plaits in chord mode)
- **Use**: Feed lush chord sources through Mojave, set to “Day” (Minor scale Sky mode), and manipulate Structure with sequenced/random CV for modal transformations.
- **Enhance**: Mult the granular pad to a stereo/image/spatializer (such as QPAS or Strymon Starlab), letting Mojave's Whirl spatialization interact with additional stereo effects. Feed outputs into a reverb module for gigantic ambient washes.

## 3. **Live Sampling Drum Loops**
- **Chain**: Drum Machine/Sampler → Mojave
- **Use**: Engage Shear mode (envelope-followed grain triggering) for rhythmically reactive granular slices based on incoming percussion.
- **Enhance**: Trigger Mojave’s Gen input via synced clock triggers from Pamela’s New Workout or a Euclidean sequencer—micro-loop glitches or cloudy breakbeats!

## 4. **Agency Over Randomness: CV and Chaos Modules**
- **Chain**: CV sources (Make Noise Maths, Wobblebug, Mutable Marbles, or Acid Rain Maestro) → Mojave’s Distribute, Drift, Structure, etc. inputs
- **Use**: Modulate Distribute and Drift to inject randomness into timing and sample positions for generative soundscapes.
- **Enhance**: Use quantizers (like Intellijel Scales or Doepfer A-156) inline with Mojave’s Structure or Speed CV for musically relevant evolving melodies.

## 5. **Multichannel Feedback and Layering**
- **Chain**: Mojave audio outputs → Mixer → Send/Return → Back to Mojave input + Effects
- **Use**: With Gust controlling reverb/feedback and careful gain structure, create evolving feedback textures that Mojave constantly re-granulates.
- **Enhance**: Patch Dune output to another module as evolving CV modulation (e.g., filter cutoff or delay time elsewhere), using the environment-generated CV to animate the rest of your rack.

## 6. **Onboard Microphone: Ambient Performer**
- **Patch**: Activate mic for live room/ambient sounds. Use Mojave as a lo-fi tape/texture module, granularizing whatever happens in your space. Inner feedback patches, scraping piezo mics, or acoustic instruments work beautifully!
- **Enhance**: Use envelope followers (Mutable Ears, Doepfer A-119) on Mojave’s output to trigger envelopes based on the intensity of the granular cloud.

## 7. **Generative or Interactive Installations**
- **Chain**: Random CV generators (Marbles, Maestro) → Mojave’s Zone, Size, and Speed. 
- **Use**: In Twilight Sky mode, Mojave breaks from scale/rhythm for chaotic, unpredictable generations—ideal for installations or sound art pieces.
- **Enhance**: Using Narwhal web app, deeply customize scales, scales, and Dune output to connect Mojave as a brain for larger generative setups.

## 8. **Rhythmic Granular Percussion**
- **Patch**: Use short sampled percussive hits and trigger grains in Chisel mode from a gate sequencer (e.g., Malekko Varigate or Noise Engineering Zularic Repetitor).
- **Enhance**: Sequence Distribute and Whirl for 'ratcheted', dislocated, or panning clusters—pseudo-electronic percussion unique to granular synthesis.

---

## **Bonus Tips**
- **Stereo Processing**: Mojave handles stereo, so multichannel sources (drum loops, field recordings, stereo synths) are prime candidates.
- **Integration with DAW**: Use Mojave’s USB for firmware and Narwhal for deep configuration—great for hybrid studio setups.
- **CV-Output Modulation**: Feed Dune output to modulate external filters/VCA for environmentally reactive modulation.

# Creative Uses for Ornament & Crime: Patching Strategies & Module Pairings

The Ornament & Crime (O&C) is extraordinarily versatile, providing quantization, sequencing, LFOs, envelope generation, chaos CVs, reference voltages, and more. Here are some creative patch ideas and module pairings that unlock novel possibilities:

---

## 1. **CopierMaschine: Polyphonic Quantized CV Recorder**
- **What it does:** Four-stage “analogue shift register” with quantization, scale masking, delay, and S&H tricks.
- **Try this:**
    - *Combination:* Pair with a multi-output sequencer (e.g. **Malekko Voltage Block** or **Intellijel Metropolix**) running slow, dreamy sequences. Route each quantized output from O&C into four separate oscillators (**Doepfer A-110**, **Mutable Plaits**, etc) for instant chord memory/voicing.
    - *More Depth:* Clock O&C’s ASR from unusual rhythmic sources (e.g., a **Mutable Grids** or any Euclidean rhythm generator). Modulate the ‘buf.index’ with an LFO or random source for unpredictable delays and generative melodies.

---

## 2. **Harrington 1200 / Automatonnetz: Chord Progression Engine**
- **What it does:** Tonnetz-based triad generator with hands-on, triggerable transformations and chord sequencing.
- **Try this:**
    - *Combination:* Use outputs B/C/D into a group of oscillators with a **4ms VCA Matrix** for chord morphs and key changes. Patch outputs through individual envelope-VCA-VCF chains for lush pads or evolving textures.
    - *Automation:* Automate inversion and mode via an **Expert Sleepers FH-2/CV expander** for programmable control over harmony shifts and modulations.
    - *Euclidean Triggers:* Pair with a **NE Stoicheia** or **ALM Pamela’s Pro Workout** for complex, polyrhythmic chord progressions.

---

## 3. **Quantermain / Meta-Q: Quad/dual Advanced Quantizer**
- **What it does:** Four fully independent quantizers with user/scale editing and complex internal CV sources.
- **Try this:**
    - *Generic combo:* Use with a chaotic/random CV generator (**Make Noise Wogglebug**, **SSF Ultra-Random**). Send four outputs to four voices, or two to voices and two to modulation inputs elsewhere for “musical randomization.”
    - *Microtonality:* Program custom scales or select microtonal tunings. Pair with tunable VCOs (**Intellijel Dixie II+** or **Verbos Complex Oscillator**) for quarter-tone or Bohlen-Pierce experiments.
    - *Continuous quantization:* Use cnt+ or cnt- modes for pitch glide/portamento effects, feeding an LFO or stepped CV in for rich, evolving, but always "in-scale" pitch lines.

---

## 4. **Quadraturia: Quad Wavetable LFO Factory**
- **What it does:** Four phase-locked or ratioed waveform LFOs with wave/morph/offset/spread and tap tempo.
- **Try this:**
    - *AM/FM Modulation Matrix:* Patch each Quadraturia output to modulate the cutoff on different filters, the FM input on oscillators, or the morph input on wavetable modules.
    - *Animated Stereo:* Send LFO outputs to panners, delay times, and VCA amplitudes across your stereo field for shifting, psychedelic spatialization (**Happy Nerding PanMix**, **Doepfer A-134**).
    - *Audio Rate for Wavetable FX:* Use high frequency settings, filter the results, and treat as lo-fi oscillators or complex modulation signals.

---

## 5. **Low-rents: Chaotic CV Catalysts**
- **What it does:** Lorenz and Rössler attractor CV generation: high-dimensional, never-repeating chaos.
- **Try this:**
    - *Wild Modulation:* Patch to filter cutoffs, oscillator wave morphs, VCAs, or digital effect parameters for evolving, organic textures.
    - *Scope Show:* Patch outputs to a vector oscilloscope (**LZX Visual Cortex**, **Junsi DS212**) for mesmerizing generative visuals along with your sound.
    - *Locked Chaos:* Modulate Rho/c with sequenced voltages for semi-predictable, “controllable” chaos.

---

## 6. **Piqued: Quad Envelope & Rhythmic Architect**
- **What it does:** Four highly programmable, voltage-controllable envelope generators with Euclidean triggering.
- **Try this:**
    - *Euclidean Percussion:* Use to generate complex rhythmic envelopes into drum modules (**ALM Akemie’s Taiko**, **Noise Engineering Basimilus Iteritas**).
    - *Rhythm to Modulation:* Gate-modulate filter or effect modules, or create choppy stutter effects on audio/CV VCA paths.
    - *CV Looper Modes:* Turn looping envelope types into complex LFOs, which you can further route or crosspatch for pseudo-generative behaviour.

---

## 7. **Sequins: Step Sequence Everything**
- **What it does:** Two channels, four sequences each, up to 16 steps/sequence, sequence chaining, voltage addressing, and envelope outs.
- **Try this:**
    - *Programmable Carrier/Modulator Pair:* Use the two channels to address the main oscillator’s pitch and a secondary modulation parameter (e.g., wavefold, filter, FM amount) for “meta-sequencing.”
    - *Permutation/Glitch:* Use external CVs to address sequence step or length for generative results. Feed Korg SQ-1, Make Noise Pressure Points, or similar sequencers for hands-on performance.

---

## 8. **Dialectic Ping Pong: Bouncing Ball LFOs**
- **What it does:** Simulates balls bouncing for complex, decaying/accelerating envelopes—lovely for organic trigger sources or wild modulation.
- **Try this:**
    - *Organic Percussion:* Patch into plucked-string modules (**Mutable Elements**, **Endorphin.es Blck_Noir**) or LPGs for naturalistic triggering.
    - *Gravity Modulated by CV:* Automate gravity/bounce loss with modulation for ultra-lifelike, self-evolving modulations. Pair with a joystick or manual CV controller for “playing” gravities live.

---

## 9. **Viznutcracker, Sweet!: Bytebeat Synthesis & Sequencing**
- **What it does:** Four independent Bytebeat equations; can be audio rate or sloooow CV for algorithmic sequences.
- **Try this:**
    - *Audio Processing:* Patch raw (lo-fi) audio to a filter bank (**Mutable Shelves**, **Intellijel Polaris**) for digital chiptune/grit fun.
    - *Bytebeat CV Sequencing:* Set speed low, use result as stepped CV into quantizers, LPGs, or morphable effect parameters. Can act as unpredictable, “mathematical” melody/morph source.

---

## 10. **Acid Curds: Algorithmic Chord Machine/Sequencer**
- **What it does:** Step/fixed CV-triggered chord progressions, with voicing, inversion, and direction options.
- **Try this:**
    - *Polyphonic Chords:* Outputs -> four oscillators (or a polysynth accepting multiple pitch/gate inputs, e.g. **Poly End Poly 2**), for patchable polyphony with evolving, sequenced chords.
    - *CV addressing:* Use a joystick, touch surface, or random voltages to select chord progressions for live harmonic improvisation.
    - *Rhythmic Progressions:* Use drum triggers or percussion gates to step through chord progressions for live, performance-timed harmonic changes.

---

## 11. **References: Precision Tuning, Calibration, & Metering**
- **What it does:** Reference voltages for tuning/calibration, high-precision frequency and BPM metering, note tuning, closed-loop VCO calibration.
- **Try this:**
    - *Tuning Utility:* Use as VCO reference to build “just-tuned” chords or sequence precise microtonal intervals.
    - *Frequency Cross-Referencing:* Pair with **Expert Sleepers Disting** or **Korg Tuner** for module calibration, tape/field recording sync checks, or even comparative testing in a modular system.
    - *Live BPM Sync:* Meticulously sync vintage drum machines or DAW clocks via the BPM output.

---

### Bonus: **All-In-One Generative Patch**
- **Example Recipe:**
    - Run Piqued in Euclidean mode to trigger outputs of Quantermain in LFSR Turing Machine mode.
    - Send Quantermain channels to four oscillators, running through VCA/VCFs, whose cutoff/modulation is controlled by Quadraturia’s LFOs.
    - Send another Piqued channel to trigger Low-rents reset, and Quantized outputs to Viznutcracker, Sweet! (running slow, for algorithmic sequence modulation).
    - Cross-patch with a logic module (**Doepfer A-166**, **Intellijel OR**) for generative, never-repeating soundscapes!

---

## General Module Type Recommendations
- **Envelope Followers:** Patch Oscillator or external audio through an envelope follower, modulate O&C parameters in real-time (“audio to harmony” patches).
- **Matrix Mixers (e.g., Doepfer A-138m):** Route multiple O&C outs to multiple mod targets, hands-on blend for complex animation.
- **Random Generators / S&H:** Feed their signals into O&C quantizer/scaler for musical randomness.
- **Logic Processors & Gate Sequence Modules:** Combine O&C triggers with Boolean logic (**SSF Propagate**, **Doepfer A-166**) to unlock advanced rhythm/switching.
- **Manual CV Controllers/Touch Plates:** For live performance and “macro” control of major O&C parameters—especially awesome with chord machines, chaos, or bytebeat settings.

---

## “Deep Dive” Utility Use Cases

- **Calibration:** Precise calibration for all modules; reference voltages for troubleshooting.
- **Testing Other Modules:** Feed known multichannel O&C outputs into new filters/mixers/etc for module reviews and development.

---

This summary just scratches the surface. **O&C is a system expander**—with the right patching, it can elevate any modular setup, from generative ambient to precision-tuned minimalism, quirky grooves, or chaotic sound design.

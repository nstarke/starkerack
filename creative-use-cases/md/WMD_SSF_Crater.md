# Creative Patch Ideas: WMD Crater Hybrid Kick Drum

The **WMD Crater** is a deep, feature-packed percussion voice for Eurorack, specialized for earth-shattering kick drums. With analog and digital layers, extensive CV control, and flexible shaping/tone options, it’s begging to be the center of wild patching experiments. Let’s explore some creative combinations with other modules!

---

## 1. Massive Modulated Kick Layers

- **CV Sequence the PITCH & ENVELOPE:**  
  Use a sequencer (Intellijel Metropolix, Make Noise Rene, or any 1V/Oct pitch/gate sequencer) to send melodic or pseudo-melodic lines into Crater’s PITCH and SUSTAIN. Great for acid or melodic techno kicks.
- **CV Randomness:**  
  Send random voltages or stepped voltages from a source like Mutable Instruments Marbles or Turing Machine into PITCH ENVELOPE AMOUNT and/or CLICK TIMBRE. This yields ultra-human, shifting kick character.

## 2. Dynamic Drive & Clipping Madness

- **Envelope Follower or CV Modulator:**  
  Run a drum loop or bass through an envelope follower (Doepfer A-119 or Mutable Ears), and patch the output to CRATER's SATURATION CV. This causes kicks to saturate more/less depending on the dynamics of other material: killer for energy surges!
- **Footswitch or Manual Trigger to CLIPPING:**  
  Use a manual gate/momentary switch (Doepfer A-164-1) into the CLIPPING circuit’s CV (via an external VCA/CV-addressed switch if necessary) to execute live transitions between clean and brutal distorted kicks.

## 3. Multidrum Sound Design

- **CLICK OUT to FX Chain:**  
  If you want independent processing, mult the output and send a separate instance of Crater’s CLICK into a reverb (Make Noise Erbe-Verb), resonator (Mutable Rings), or tape delay (Bastl Thyme) for glitchy click textures.
- **Noise Sidechaining:**  
  Patch a noise source (ALM SFG or Erica Pico Noise) into the Crater’s CLICK LEVEL/CLICK TIMBRE via CV—modulate click with noise sweeps/gates for tight, industrial impacts.

## 4. Polyrhythmic Bass Drums

- **Multiple Triggers & Accents:**  
  Use a trigger sequencer with multiple outs (ALM Pam’s New Workout, Tiptop Circadian Rhythms), patching regular triggers to TRIGGER and sporadic ones to ACCENT. Staggering the two opens up fast rhythm layering from subtle to bombastic.
- **Probability and Euclidean Kicks:**  
  Employ a probability-based trigger module (Mutable Grids, Rebel Technology Stoicheia) to let the Crater fire only on certain steps—perfect for evolving, never-static grooves.

## 5. Monster Basslines from One Drum Module

- **Gated Sine Bass with SUSTAIN:**  
  Hold TRIGGER high (sustain mode) and send varying 1V/Oct sequences to transform Crater into a bassline synth. Modulate amplitude/decay via envelopes or even LFOs for movement.
- **Wavefolder/Distortion Post-Kick:**  
  Process the output through a wavefolder (Frap Tools Falistri, Intellijel Bifold) or a distortion pedal/module for even gnarlier tones.

## 6. Performance and Sound System Trickeries

- **LED Display VU Meter:**  
  Use the LED as a visual cue in performance—modulate parameters with CV that are in time with visual elements.
- **Envelope Follower for Ducking Effects:**  
  Send Crater’s output through an envelope follower, and use its output to sidechain/duck other elements (e.g., bass, pads) for classic techno pumping.

## Module Recommendations (General)

- **Sequencers:** Intellijel Metropolix, ALM Pam’s New Workout, Make Noise Tempi.
- **Random/Probability Generators:** Mutable Marbles, Music Thing Turing Machine.
- **Envelopes/LFOs:** Maths, Intellijel Quadrax.
- **Distortion/Fx:** Noise Engineering Ruina, Erica Synths Fusion Distortion.
- **VCAs & Mixers:** Happy Nerding 3x VCA, Intellijel Quad VCA for dynamic mixing/CV control.
- **CV Utilities:** After Later Blend, Doepfer A-138 for creative CV mixing and scaling.
- **Envelope Followers/External Audio In:** Mutable Ears, Doepfer A-119.

Explore, experiment, and don’t be afraid to push the Crater into non-traditional uses (FM source, subharmonics oscillator, noise generator, etc). Eurorack rewards curiosity!

# Creative Patching Ideas for the Erogenous Tones LEVIT8

The **LEVIT8** is a highly flexible 8-channel attenuator, inverter, mixer, and offset generator. Here are some ways you can get the most out of this powerful utility by pairing it with other Eurorack modules or categories of modules:

---

## 1. CV Processor/Transformer

**Use With:**  
- LFOs (e.g. Make Noise Maths, Intellijel Quadra)
- Sequencers (e.g. Make Noise René, Intellijel Metropolis)
- Function Generators

**Patch Ideas:**  
- Invert, attenuate, and combine multiple modulation sources before sending them to a destination (filter, VCO, VCA, etc.).
- Pan LFOs from subtle modulation to full inversion for creating new rhythmic patterns.
- Add or subtract fixed voltage offsets to modulate parameters beyond the standard C.V. range.

**Result:**  
- Rich evolving modulations and deeper parameter control, perfect for animating drones, creating stepped modulations, or expanding melodic patterns.

---

## 2. CV-Controllable Mixer for Oscillators or Audio Signals

**Use With:**  
- VCOs (Mutable Instruments Plaits, Intellijel Dixie II+)
- Noise Generators & Drum Modules

**Patch Ideas:**  
- Combine up to eight audio sources, then send four-channel, two four-channel, or an eight-channel mix to effects or filters.
- Use the inversion on drums for phase cancellation and interesting transient shaping.
- Feedback audio into itself using an effects loop (try combining with delay modules like 4ms Dual Looping Delay).

---

## 3. Performance Mixer/Live Utility

**Use With:**  
- Manual trigger modules (e.g. 2hp Trim, Mutable Instruments Shades)
- Sampler modules (e.g. Morphagene, Bitbox)

**Patch Ideas:**  
- Fade in/out goosebumps moments in live performance by hand-attenuating samples, field recordings, or percussive loops.
- Use the normalization to create live voltage-controlled gates, slicing signal up/down with the inversion switches.

---

## 4. Voltage Offset and Waveshaping

**Use With:**  
- Wavefolders/waveshapers (e.g. Instruō Tš-L, Doepfer A-137)
- Quantizers (e.g. Intellijel Scales)

**Patch Ideas:**  
- Use LEVIT8 to add or subtract voltage from audio/CV signals, exploring the saturated range for 'distortion'-like effects.
- Drive quantizer input in/out of range with offset, for generative phrase variation, probability locks, or glitchy melodies.

---

## 5. Gate/Trigger Logic Mixing

**Use With:**  
- Gate/logic modules (e.g. Mutable Instruments Branches, Doepfer A-166)
- Drum sequencers

**Patch Ideas:**
- Mix gates with offset for pseudo-AND/OR behavior, or to combine rhythm and triggers creatively.
- Shape envelopes by attenuating triggers or summing gates to hit essential drum modules with composite rhythms.

---

## 6. Polyrhythmic Mixer

**Use With:**  
- Clock dividers/multipliers (e.g. 4ms Rotating Clock Divider, Pamela’s New Workout)
- Drum modules

**Patch Ideas:**
- Mix several clock or rhythmic gate signals with varying attenuations and inversions for instant polyrhythms/grooves.
- Create “swing” by sum-mixing slightly offset clocks, then using as master clock for sequencers.

---

## 7. Crossfader & Stereo Imaging

**Use With:**
- Stereo signal processors (Happy Nerding PanMix, Erica Synths Stereo Mixer)

**Patch Ideas:**
- Use adjacent channels as manual or voltage-controlled crossfaders between two signals.
- Pan sounds in creative ways by ‘offsetting’ CV to panners—use the inversion switches for negative phase L/R motion.

---

## 8. Feedback/Resonance Network

**Use With:**
- Delay, Reverb, or Distortion FX modules

**Patch Ideas:**
- Patch output of effects back into LEVIT8 to combine clean and processed signals, creating feedback loops with hands-on voltage control!
- Force signals into saturation using the module’s own voltage range, for self-distorting, overdriven timbres.

---

## 9. Random & Probability Engine

**Use With:**
- Random/Noise modules (e.g. ALM Pamela’s PRO Workout, Mutable Instruments Marbles)

**Patch Ideas:**
- Route multiple random sources, attenuate/invert/mix, and then use as control voltage for other modules for generative patches.
- Insert offsets for shifting random distribution.

---

## Utility Tips

- Use the **normalization to 5V** for straightforward offset generation: with nothing patched in, channels can be used as manual voltage sources (up to 10V or -10V).
- **LED feedback** gives instant visual cues, excellent for live performance.

---

LEVIT8 is a deceptively deep module. Creative routing and thoughtful combination with other utilities will open up worlds of new sounds and control options!

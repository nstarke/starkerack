# Creative Ways to Use the 2hp Brst Eurorack Module

The 2hp Brst is a compact, voltage-controlled burst generator and trigger delay that can add unique rhythmic, generative, and humanized qualities to your modular synthesizer patches. Here’s how you can creatively combine Brst with other modules for maximum fun and utility:


## 1. **Granular Percussion:**
- **Combine With:** Drum modules (e.g., Mutable Instruments Peaks, Tiptop Audio ONE)
- **How:** Use Brst to send bursts into your drum or percussive modules, giving you rapid-fire transient attacks—think glitch, cluster fills, or ‘machine-gun’ snare rolls in IDM.
- **Pro Tip:** Modulate the PULSES or RATE input with an LFO for dynamic, fluid rolls rather than static bursts.

---

## 2. **Turing Machine-Style Random Rhythms:**
- **Combine With:** Random voltage sources (e.g., Music Thing Modular Turing Machine, Noise Engineering Mimetic Digitalis), Clock Dividers/Logics
- **How:** Patch random CV into RATE or PULSES for bursts of variable length and speed, creating unpredictable trigger stream textures to clock logic modules, switches, or random quantizers.

---

## 3. **Humanize Your Sequencer:**
- **Combine With:** Step sequencers (e.g., Make Noise Rene, Arturia Keystep)
- **How:** Use Brst to trigger drum accents, ghost notes, or ratcheting effects—set a clock divider to only send triggers on certain steps for lively, non-repetitive patterns.

---

## 4. **Chaotic Bouncing Ball Physics:**
- **Combine With:** Envelope Followers, VCAs, or Integrators
- **How:** Use burst output to create rapid trigger streams that ‘fade’ (by sending to a VCA-controlled envelope), emulating the rhythm of a bouncing ball losing energy.
- **Example Patch:** Patch OUT to a VCA, CV Brst's RATE with a slow envelope/integrator so successive pulses are farther apart—a natural ‘falling bouncing ball’ sound!

---

## 5. **Trigger-based Synth Effects:**
- **Combine With:** Sample players, Choppers (e.g., Bastl Microgranny, Make Noise Morphagene)
- **How:** Use burst output to granularly re-trigger sounds, initiate buffer scrubs, or gate retriggers. Great for glitch or stutter effects.

---

## 6. **Voltage-Controlled Euclidean/Ratcheting Rhythms:**
- **Combine With:** Euclidean Sequencers (e.g., vpme.de Euclidean Circles) or Manual Gates
- **How:** Send bursts into step or rhythm patterns to add ratcheting or fill effects. Use CV control for morphing drum break complexity during performance.

---

## 7. **Polyphonic/Unison Voice Stacking:**
- **Combine With:** Polyphonic Oscillators (e.g., Mutable Instruments Plaits), or External MIDI-to-CV Converters
- **How:** Use Brst for entry-level voice stacking/strumming effects—send a burst of triggers to voice gates for slightly offset attack times.

---

## 8. **Randomized/Modulated Bursts for SFX:**
- **Combine With:** Reverb, Delay, or Wavefolders
- **How:** Rapid bursts into effect processors can create runaway feedback or exploding digital noise textures.

---

### **Quick Patch Tips**
- **Clock Input:** Use a standard clock or trigger as input to Brst for tempo-synced effects.
- **CV Modulation:** Animate PULSES and RATE with LFOs, Envelopes, or Random voltage for evolving results.
- **Logic Combos:** Combine Brst’s output with logic modules (AND, OR, XOR) for complex rhythmic structures.

---

### **Module Pairing Quicklist**
- Mutable Instruments Peaks/Plaits (drums/perc)
- Make Noise Maths (for animated burst modulation)
- Intellijel Tetrapad/Tête (touch control for live burst injection)
- Mutable Instruments Marbles (random triggers)
- Acid Rain Maestro (tempo-synced LFO bursts)

## Let Your Imagination Burst

Brst’s compact form belies its rhythmic, generative power. Use it anywhere a snappy, voltage-controllable stream of triggers can add depth, variation, or mayhem. Experiment with feedback loops, modulation, and chaining for unexpected results!

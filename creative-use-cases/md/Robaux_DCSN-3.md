# Creative Patch Ideas for Robaux Decision Tree (DCSN3)

The **Robaux Decision Tree DCSN3** is a highly flexible random signal router and clock divider. Here are several patch strategies that leverage its unique capabilities, designed for maximum creativity and modular synergy!

---

## 1. **Randomized Percussion Splitting**

### **Patch Concept:**  
Feed a steady clock (from, e.g., Pamela’s New Workout or 4ms QCD) into the **Decision Tree input**. Route the 9 sub-outputs (E-M) to various drum modules (e.g., Mutable Instruments Peaks, Tiptop Audio ONE, ALM Squid Salmple, or any analog drum module).

### **Result:**  
Each clock pulse gets randomly assigned to a drum voice, creating highly dynamic, non-repeating percussion patterns.

### **Tip:**  
Adjust the **random/repeat knob** to morph between chaos and looping 16-step patterns for variation and control.

## 2. **Melodic Gate & Voice Randomizer**

- **Modules:** Quantizer (e.g., Intellijel Scales), multiple simple VCOs, VCA, envelope generator.
- **Patch:** Route sub-outputs to trigger envelopes for multiple voice lanes. Use sequencer or quantizer CVs and let the Decision Tree randomly decide which voice plays the current note/gate.
- **Variation:** In Poly/Poly mode, you can get chords or polyphonic textures by sending the same clock to a VCO set to drone, and letting the Decision Tree's poly gates trigger different voice pathways.

---

## 3. **Random Routing for Modulation**

- **Modules:** LFO (e.g., Batumi, Maths), Filter Bank, Multimode Filter
- **Patch:** Use an LFO (or envelope/LPG) output as the input. Send the sub-outputs to modulate the cutoff on several filters (or different modulation destinations on a multi-voice synth). 
- **Outcome:** The modulation source jumps randomly between destinations, creating organic interruptions and timbral movement.

---

## 4. **Clock Division Polyphony / Polyrhythm Generator**

- **Modules:** Multiple percussion synths, sequencers, or sequential switches.
- **Patch:** Use Decision Tree in **clock divider mode** (classic, 2/3/5, or spread). Feed a fast master clock in and distribute the divided clocks to different sequencer advance inputs, drum hits, or other timing-critical events.
- **Outcome:** Instantly generate shifting polyrhythms or create a multi-channel step-sequencer with unique step lengths.

---

## 5. **Generative Gate Logic Expansion**

- **Modules:** Logic (e.g., Doepfer A-166, Intellijel Plog), Sample & Hold (S&H), Random CV source.
- **Patch:** Use Decision Tree outputs to trigger S&H modules sampling various modulations or random voltages.
- **Variation:** Run a single rhythm/gate through the module and use each output to trigger related, but different, actions—adding logic modules after allows combining outputs for even more complex gate structures.

---

## 6. **“Intelligent” Audio Chopper**

- **Modules:** Audio Switch (e.g., A-150, WMD Sequential Switch), Effects modules.
- **Patch:** Use the Decision Tree outputs to sequentially or randomly switch audio sources or direct the same audio to different effects returns.
- **Result:** Random, on-beat re-routing of audio signals; can be used for glitching effects, generative audio paths, or pseudo-granular playback.

---

## 7. **Polyphonic Chord Creator (Spread Mode at Audio Rate)**

- **Modules:** Single Square-Wave VCO, VCA, Mixer
- **Patch:** Feed a square VCO at audio rates into the Decision Tree, set to **Spread Mode**. Tap the outputs to a mixer. You get frequency-divided harmonic content—a pseudo-organ or rich chord cluster from a single oscillator.
- **Advanced:** Pass each output through different effects or filters for “ensemble” textures.

---

## 8. **Randomized Effect Triggering**

- **Modules:** FX modules with gate/CV inputs (e.g., delays with freeze, spectral processors, bit crushers).
- **Patch:** Use Decision Tree to trigger various effects' gate/CV inputs with random or rhythmic gates.
- **Variation:** Use Latch mode for effects that should stay activated until another random trigger comes along.

---

## General Module Recommendations

- **Drum Modules:** Tiptop Audio/Erica Synths/ALM/Mutable
- **Sequencers:** Squarp Hermod (for CV/gate capture), Make Noise René, Intellijel Metropolis
- **Mixers/Switches:** Doepfer A-151, Sequential Switches
- **Random/Noise:** Mutable Marbles, Wogglebug, 2hp Turing Machine
- **Logic/Gate Tools:** Intellijel Plog, Doepfer A-166, Ladik S-180 series
- **FX:** Mutable Instruments Clouds/Beads, 4ms Dual Looping Delay, ALM MFX

---

## Pro Tips

- **Reset Input:** Sync patterns from external sequencers via the hidden reset jack (see manual for activation).
- **Debug Mode:** Use for troubleshooting during live sets.
- **Latch Modes:** Perfect for “sample & gate hold” scenarios or unpredictable yet controlled gating and switching needs.
- **Mode Cycling:** For performance, modulate the mode (if possible) or hands-on-tweak to animate your set.

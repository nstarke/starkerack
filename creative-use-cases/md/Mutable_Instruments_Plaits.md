# Creative Ways to Use Mutable Instruments Plaits in Eurorack

Plaits is a powerful and versatile sound source capable of classic subtractive, FM, additive, physical modeling, and percussive synthesis. Below are creative patch ideas and module combinations to push its sonic potential further.

---

## 1. **Textural Layering with Clouds or Beads (Granular FX)**
* **How**: Patch Plaits’ OUT and AUX into left/right inputs of Mutable Instruments *Clouds* (or *Beads*) for stereo granular processing.
* **What Happens**: Get lush evolving textures by freezing, time-stretching, and mangling Plaits’ evolving timbres.
* **Try**: Scan through wavetable or chord modes on Plaits, then freeze and modulate in Clouds for ethereal pads or granular washes.

---

## 2. **Animated Timbres with LFO/Envelope Modulation**
* **How**: Use an advanced LFO like *Mutable Instruments Tides* or *ALM Pam’s New Workout* to modulate TIMBRE, MORPH, and HARMONICS in sync or at audio rates.
* **What Happens**: Creates dynamic, evolving sounds, rhythmic pulses, and complex motion in chord, wavetable, or resonator models.
* **Try**: Envelope generators (eg. *Intellijel Quadra*, *Make Noise Maths*) for percussive modulation, or feed a random LFO for evolving, organic variations.

---

## 3. **Physical Modeling: Excite Rings with Plaits**
* **How**: Patch AUX or OUT from Plaits’ physical models (*e.g*., inharmonic string, modal resonator) to the *audio input of Mutable Instruments Rings*.
* **What Happens**: Use Plaits as an exciter to “strike” Rings, vastly expanding physical modeling textures and plucks.
* **Try**: Adjusted dust noise or drum models on Plaits for unconventional exciter material.

---

## 4. **Percussive Madness with Sequencers and Gates**
* **How**: Sequence rapid triggers/gates (from *ALM Pamela’s New Workout*, *Intellijel Metropolis*, *Eloquencer*) to Plaits’ TRIG input in drum/snare/hi-hat modes.
* **What Happens**: Plaits becomes a full drum voice module, especially strong when different models are “morphed” and accented via LEVEL CV.
* **Try**: Use gate probability/randomization to shift between snare, bass, and hats for glitchy beats.

---

## 5. **Rich Polyphony with External Quantizers and Arpeggiators**
* **How**: Chain a quantizer module (*Intellijel Scales*, *Doepfer A-156*) to the V/OCT input, clocked by a sequential voltage source or arpeggiator.
* **What Happens**: Gives you tuned melodic control for chords, wavetables, and FM sounds.
* **Try**: Randomized quantized voltages to morph through Plaits’ models for generative soundscapes.

---

## 6. **Spectral Processing with Filters and Vocoders**
* **How**: Send Plaits OUT/AUX to complex filter banks (*Doepfer A-128*, *Mutable Blinds* in VCA mode) or external vocoder modules.
* **What Happens**: Sculpt the harmonics further, or use Plaits’ speech models through vocoders for wild robotic vocal FX.
* **Try**: Modulate filter cutoff with Plaits’ internal envelope or external CV for shifting vowel tones and deep movement in the mix.

---

## 7. **Self-Modulation and Feedback Fun**
* **How**: Mult or send an attenuated copy of Plaits’ OUT/AUX back into TIMBRE or MORPH CV inputs.
* **What Happens**: Self-patching creates instability, wild modulation, and can bring out unexpected cross-modulation artifacts.
* **Try**: Use lowpass gates (Make Noise Optomix) for additional dynamic control in the feedback loop.

---

## 8. **Accent and Dynamics with Analog VCAs & Envelopes**
* **How**: Send Plaits’ trigger envelope to control an external VCA (*Intellijel Quad VCA*), or use Plaits' LEVEL CV with sidechain-modulated VCA modules.
* **What Happens**: Dynamic articulation and control of amplitude, external compression, or gating.
* **Try**: Use a sequencer with accents to CV Plaits’ LEVEL input in percussive models for dynamic drum lines.

---

## 9. **Stereo/Spatial Tricks**
* **How**: Patch OUT and AUX to different effects and pan each independently (*e.g.*, into *Erica Synths Black Stereo Delay*, *4ms Dual Looping Delay*).
* **What Happens**: Create wide, immersive stereo fields with related yet distinct processed signals.
* **Try**: Use a stereo mixer or soundstage module for positioning Plaits voices in space.

---

## 10. **CV-Controlled Morphing Drum Kits**
* **How**: Use a sequencer or voltage-addressed switch (*Doepfer A-150*) to step through drum/percussion models, controlling drum “kits” live via CV.
* **What Happens**: Seamless morphing between electronic drum timbres, or totally new hybridized drum sounds.
* **Try**: Modulate MORPH/DECAY for expressive fills and rolls.

## Recommended Utility Modules for Creative Plaits Patching

- **CV Mixers/Attenuverters**: Mutable Instruments *Blinds*, MI *Shades*
- **Clock Dividers/Random Generators**: *ALM Pamela’s New Workout*, *Mutable Marbles*
- **Envelope Followers**: *Doepfer A-119*, for externally modulated “accent” on Plaits
- **Wavefolders/Distortion**: *Dreadbox Euphoria*, *Doepfer A-137-1* for even more harmonics
- **External Audio Input**: Route external audio to filter models for pseudo vocoder/FX tones

**Explore, Experiment, and Embrace Happy Accidents!**  
Mutable Instruments Plaits is made for creative abuse. Mult its outputs, modulate everything, and don’t be afraid to break the rules.

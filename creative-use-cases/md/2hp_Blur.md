# Creative Ideas for Using 2hp Blur in Eurorack

2hp Blur is a unique spectral processor focused on time-stretching and frequency spreading, with extremely compact HP. Here’s how you can push your patch design further by integrating Blur with other modules:

---

## 1. **Morphing Textures from Percussive Sound Sources**
- **Pair with:** *2hp Pluck / Mutable Instruments Plaits (in percussive mode) / Make Noise Mysteron*
- **How:** Feed sharp, percussive sounds (plucks, hats, FM hits, etc.) into Blur. Use the **Vibe** to smear transients and **Time** to stretch these into shimmering, pad-like textures.
- **Tip:** Modulate Time or Vibe with slow LFOs for ever-evolving ambient washes.

---

## 2. **CV Animation for Cinematic Pads**
- **Pair with:** *LFO/random source (like Batumi, Pamela’s New Workout, Wogglebug)*
- **How:** Patch LFOs or sample & hold CV to the **Vibe** and **Time** CV inputs. Modulate the Mix for crossfading between “dry” and “wet” spectral layers.
- **Result:** Pads animate themselves, moving between realistic and surreal with little manual tweaking.

---

## 3. **Spectral “Freezer” for Live Performance**
- **Pair with:** *Manual gate/button module (like Mutable Instruments Shades/Frap Tools 321 for momentary bias)*
- **How:** Use fast changes on the **Time** parameter to “freeze” and hold tiny grains of whatever’s being played. Re-trigger or CV sweep Time for glitchy stutter effects. Great if you have a footswitch or tactile controller.

---

## 4. **Stereo Soundscapes with Dual Blur and Reverb**
- **Pair with:** *2x Blur modules, stereo reverb (like 2hp Verb / Strymon Magneto / Intellijel Multi-FX / FX Aid)*
- **How:** Run two different sources—or the same source split and independently modulated—through separate Blurs. Pan L/R, combine after with a stereo verb for huge ambient fields.
- **Tip:** Try varying the Time and Vibe offsets on each channel for maximal width.

---

## 5. **Harmonic Processing on Oscillator Swarms**
- **Pair with:** *2hp Swarm, Super Saw oscillators (Verbos Harmonic Oscillator, Studio Electronics Tonestar, MI Warps in "Super Saw" mode)*
- **How:** Massive detuned oscillator stacks fed into Blur create lush moving textures. Use the Vibe to emulsify the harmonic content into immersive pads.
- **Tip:** Sequence Swarm for chord changes. Modulate Blur to keep the pad evolving.

---

## 6. **Pitch Shifting and Harmonic Layering**
- **Pair with:** *Pitch shifter (2hp Pitch, Mutable Instruments Rings/Clouds with pitch processing, Doepfer A-196 PLL for wildness)*
- **How:** Process Blur’s output through a pitch shifter to generate fifths, octaves, or more complex intervals—great for lush, harmonically rich backdrops.
- **Example:** Sequence the pitch with melodic CV to create blurred, shifting melodic ambient beds.

---

## 7. **Feed Reverb, Delay, or Granular FX for Maximal Ambience**
- **Pair with:** *Reverb module (2hp Verb, Make Noise Erbe-Verb, Strymon Magneto), Delay (MIMEOPHON, DLD, 2hp Delay), or Granular (Arbhar, Clouds)*
- **How:** Place Blur before or after these spatial effects. Wet, stretched spectral output becomes even more enveloping and complex post reverb/delay.
- **Tip:** Feedback Blur output _back into_ time-based effect input chains for lush, cycling atmospheres.

---

## 8. **Dynamic Mixing and Performance FX**
- **Pair with:** *Manual faders/crossfaders (Doepfer A-138, WMD Performance Mixer, Happy Nerding PanMix)*
- **How:** Use Blur’s Mix under CV or manual control for performance crossfading between clean/blurred. Animate with envelopes matched to rhythm for real-time glitch, pad, and shimmer transitions.

---

## 9. **Spectral “Granular” CV Control**
- **Pair with:** *Random CV source, Envelope Generators, Sequencers*
- **How:** Sequence changes to Time and Vibe via a sequencer or random stepped CV for rhythmic or pseudo-granular effects. You can sync the spectral stretching to a beat for tempo-synced ambient stutters.

---

## 10. **Resampling and Layering with Loopers or Samplers**
- **Pair with:** *Looper (1010 Music Bitbox, Morphagene) / Samplers (Squid Salmple, Assimil8or, etc.)*
- **How:** Process audio through Blur, then sample the blurred-out results. Layer, mix, and manipulate these as unique textural building blocks for further performance.

# Creative Patch Ideas for the WMD/SSF DPLR Dual Delay

The DPLR is a remarkably flexible stereo/dual delay processor, offering crosstalk/Xtalk control, multi-mode filtering, voltage-controllable parameters, and ping-pong-like stereo field manipulation via SPREAD. Below are creative patching techniques, including module type and specific module suggestions, to unlock its potential in a modular setup.

---

## 1. **Evolving Stereo Textures with CV Modulation**

- **How:**  
  Use LFOs, function generators, or random CV sources to modulate each of the DPLR's CV inputs (DELAY CV, SPREAD CV, REGEN CV).  
- **Modules:**  
  - Mutable Instruments Tides (complex LFO)  
  - Make Noise Maths (for looping envelopes or random stepped CV)  
  - Befaco Rampage  
- **Result:**  
  Evolving, shifting stereo delays, rhythmic glitches, and psychedelic spaciness. Patch separate modulation sources to SPREAD and DELAY for constantly shifting ping-pong and time effects.

## 2. **Feedback Network Madness**

- **How:**  
  Patch DPLR’s outputs back into each other's inputs via external mixers or VCAs. Insert external effects or processing (filters, wavefolders, distortion) in these feedback loops.  
- **Modules:**  
  - Happy Nerding 3xMIA or Mutable Shades (for attenuverter/mixing feedback paths)  
  - Mutable Instruments Rings or Clouds for processing inside the feedback  
  - Any characterful VCF or wavefolder (e.g., Make Noise LxD, Intellijel Polaris)  
- **Result:**  
  Wild, howling feedback, deeply resonant or destroyed textures, controllable through both the onboard filtering and your external processing chain.

## 3. **Percussive Delay Machine**

- **How:**  
  Trigger short bursts, noise, or drum modules, and send them through DPLR. Sequence the SPREAD or XTALK modes for drum fills or glitchy stutters.  
- **Modules:**  
  - Mutable Instruments Peaks or Befaco Kickall (for percussion)  
  - Sequential switch (e.g., Doepfer A-151 or Livestock Maze) to modulate XTALK or SPREAD with a clock  
- **Result:**  
  Unique, spatially shifting percussive patterns, and dynamic drum fills with evolving placement in the stereo field.

## 4. **Karplus-Strong/Physical Modeling Resonator**

- **How:**  
  Send short plucks, triggers, or noise bursts into DPLR at very short delay times (~40ms), high feedback, and low filtering for string/bouncy sounds.  
- **Modules:**  
  - Any envelope generator + noise source or pluck (e.g., Mutable Instruments Plaits in pluck mode)  
  - Fast envelope (Intellijel Quadra, Maths, or even a trigger sequencer)  
- **Result:**  
  Karplus-Strong style synthetic plucked strings, tuned via Delay Amount—use quantized voltage for pitch sequences.

## 5. **Stereo Imaging & Ping-Pong FX on Mix Busses**

- **How:**  
  Use DPLR as a send effect on a modular mixer’s aux bus, processing entire stems or groups with discrete, Xtalk-modulated spatial delay.  
- **Modules:**  
  - Befaco Hexmix, WMD Performance Mixer, or similar that offer sends/returns  
  - Stereo panners preceding DPLR for even more movement  
- **Result:**  
  Instantly widen basic signals, add animated movement to the performance, with filter slope modes to dial in “vintage tape,” “space echo,” or “lo-fi digital” flavor.

---

## 6. **Voltage-Addressable Tape-Style Delay Manipulation**

- **How:**  
  Sequence or randomize XTALK and filter modes with gate sequencers, manual button presses, or voltage controlled switches.  
- **Modules:**  
  - 4ms Rotating Clock Divider (for rhythmic gating)  
  - Expert Sleepers Switches  
- **Result:**  
  Perform dramatic live glitching or morphing between “tape head” types and crosstalk, for rhythmic or improvisational transitions.

---

## Extended Experimentation

- **CV Cross-Patching:**  
  Use different random or chaotic CV sources on each of the CV inputs—SPREAD, DELAY, REGEN—for distinct organic or “drunken” echo changes.
- **Push the Filter Slope LED:**  
  Automate changes between the four filter slopes with a manual button or sequencer for ambient, dub, or IDM breakdowns.
- **Tuned Delay Chains:**  
  Stack with digital pitch shifters (MI Warps, Tiptop Z-DSP) or granular modules after DPLR for cloudscapes or alien delay artifacts.

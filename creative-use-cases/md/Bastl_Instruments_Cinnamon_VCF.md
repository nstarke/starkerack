# Creative Patch Ideas for Bastl Cinnamon in Your Eurorack System

The **Bastl Cinnamon** is a highly characterful and flexible state-variable filter, perfect for pushing into creative sound design territory. Here are several ways you can integrate it with other Eurorack modules for inspiring results:

## 1. **Oscillator Mode Exploration**
Cinnamon can self-oscillate and yields different sine-like, saw-like, and edgy waveforms via its **Character switches**.  
**Combine with:**  
- **Quantizer module** (e.g., Tiptop Audio Quantizer, Doepfer A-156): Patch Cinnamon's self-oscillating output into a quantizer for filtered melodies that track 1V/oct when Character is off.
- **Envelope generator** (e.g., Make Noise Maths, Intellijel Quadrax): Modulate cutoff to add vibrato or filter sweeps to your "oscillator."
- **Waveshaper/distortion** (e.g., Mutable Instruments Warps): To further sculpt unique tones from the self-oscillation output.

## 2. **Character Morphing FX Filter**
The **Character switches** drastically change the resonance behavior—you can automate them for live performance FX.
**Combine with:**  
- **Manual gate/sequential switch** (e.g., Doepfer A-150, Mutable Instruments Branches): Trigger the switch positions using gates for dynamic filter timbre shifting during a sequence.
- **Envelope follower** (e.g., Endorphin.es Airstreamer, Doepfer A-119): Extract dynamics from a drum loop to automate Character switches or CV cutoff for responsive filtering.

## 3. **Dual CV Cutoff Animation**
The **Right CV** can be deeply attenuated, while the **Left CV** offers predictable pitch tracking.
**Combine with:**  
- **Dual LFO** (e.g., XAOC Batumi, Befaco Rampage): Animate both the Left and Right CV with different shapes and speeds for rich, morphing filter movement.
- **Random/chaos CV source** (e.g., Make Noise Wogglebug, Mutable Marbles): Inject randomness into one CV input for organic evolving sweeps.

## 4. **Drive + Feedback Distortion**
With the **Drive switch**, you can easily push the input into rich distortion.
**Combine with:**  
- **Audio rate oscillator** (e.g., classic VCO/complex oscillator): Run through Cinnamon with Drive enabled for overdriven tones.
- **Audio feedback path** (patch HP or BP out back into its own input, maybe via an attenuator like ALM S.B.G or Mutable Shades): Creates wild, self-modulating soundscapes.

## 5. **Multi-pass Filtering and Crossfading**
With simultaneous **low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass outputs**, use Cinnamon as a **multiband signal splitter**.
**Combine with:**  
- **Crossfader/matrix mixer** (e.g., Happy Nerding 3xMIA, Intellijel Triatt): Blend LP, BP, and HP outs dynamically for unique filter morphs.
- **Multi-effects system** (e.g., Mutable Instruments Clouds, Make Noise Mimeophon): Send different filter outs to different effects, then recombine or pan separately.

## 6. **Creative Percussive Sound Design**
Push an envelope or fast LFO into cutoff, especially in BP/HP modes, for snappy percussive sounds.
**Combine with:**  
- **Envelope generator/sequenced gates**: Use fast AD envelopes to "ping" Cinnamon for organic percussive blips (try Make Noise Maths, ALM Pip Slope).
- **Noise generator or sample playback**: Filter noise or pitch-quantized samples to create lo-fi percussion.

## 7. **Voltage-Controlled Filter Processing for External Instruments**
Use the input gain and drive controls to heat up and filter *any* line-level or modular-level audio—guitar, drum machines, DAW sends, etc.
**Combine with:**  
- **Input interface** (e.g., Intellijel Audio Interface II): Properly boost and impedance-match external gear for smooth integration.

**TIP:** Remember that extreme Character modes may disrupt proper 1V/oct tracking—a feature you can exploit intentionally for organic instability in sequence and drone patches!

# Using WMD Fracture for Densely Rhythmic and Hyper-Complex Percussion

The **WMD Fracture** is a multi-particle percussion synthesizer, ideal for creating complex rhythmic sequences, polyrhythms, and intricate textures. Here’s how you can harness its potential for hyper-complex, percussive music making:

---

## 1. **Voice Role: Multi-Particle Percussion Generator**

Fracture is a dedicated voice, capable of generating a wide range of percussive sounds: from tightly synced digital claps to stochastic audience applause and beyond. It can be a main percussive element or a unique textural layer in your patch.

---

## 2. **Density for Activity**

- **DENSITY** increases the rate of the internal particle oscillator.  
  - **High Density:** Get rapid-fire bursts and machine-gun-like textures—great for filling rhythmic “space” or creating rolls and intense grooves.
  - **Modulation Tip:** Sequence or modulate DENSITY via CV to create evolving, organic complexity and change the micro-rhythmics in real time.
- **INF (Infinite) mode:** Use this to create a never-ending particle cloud. Modulate DENSITY for dynamic, evolving walls of texture.

---

## 3. **Polyrhythms and Trigger Inputs**

- **TRIG, ACC, TICK Inputs:**  
  - **TRIG:** Core particle burst trigger.
  - **ACC:** Accent input. Use to dynamically emphasize hits and create syncopation.
  - **TICK:** For single-particle triggers—great for sub-division layering.
- **Polyrhythmic Trick:** Send different rhythmic patterns (e.g., 3/4 and 4/4 pulses) to TRIG and TICK via external sequencers or clock dividers/multipliers. This creates dense, phase-shifting textures and complex polyrhythmic interplay.
- Use trigger/gate sequencers (e.g. Euclidean, Ryk M185, or a Pamela’s New Workout) to create unpredictable, complex time signatures.

---

## 4. **Surface Selection for Timbral Variety**

- **SURFACE:** Choose from 23 types: drum sticks, snaps, switches, claps, and more.
- **Performance Tip:**  
  - Modulate or automate the SURFACE selection for morphing percussion—a unique way to create “morphing” kits or evolving rhythmic textures.

---

## 5. **Decay, Tail & Envelope Tricks for Unique Attack/Sustain**

- **DECAY:** Sets the length of bursts.  
  - **Short Decay:** Staccato, tight rhythmic articulation.
  - **Long Decay:** Dense clusters, crowd-type sounds.
- **TAIL:** Select how the envelope affects amplitude/probability for each particle:  
  - **Amplitude Mode:** Tight and punchy, good for strong transient sequences.
  - **Amplitude + Probability:** Punchy with gently decaying tails—great for a natural fade-out effect.
  - **Probability Only:** Semi-random amplitude—useful for unpredictable, glitchy rhythms.
- Try alternating TAIL modes within your arrangement for evolving percussive qualities.

---

## 6. **Pitch/Frequency and Spread for Sonic Complexity**

- **FREQ (and PUNCH modes):**
  - Control the spectral content and pitch of the bursts.
  - Use the three PUNCH modes to switch between subtle or extreme filtering and pitch movement.
  - **Live Tip:** Modulate FREQ with sequencer CVs to create melodic percussion or timbral shifts within rhythms.
- **PITCH Input:**  
  - Override FREQ to control burst pitch externally.  
  - Sequence this for percussive lines with tonal movement.
- **SPREAD:**  
  - Increases variance in pitch and stereo field: dial up for swarming, spatially complex textures.

---

## 7. **Stereo and Reverb**

- **OUT L & OUT R:**  
  - Take advantage of the true stereo output for wide, immersive percussion.
  - Route L/R to different stereo positions or even process separately for intricate spatialization.
- **REVERB:**  
  - Use built-in Room or Hall for ambience.
  - Modulate reverb parameters for swelling or “breathing” percussive effects.

---

## 8. **Performance Hacks and CV Modulation**

- **Automate everything**: All major controls accept CV—the key to hyper-complexity is sending in modulated CV from LFOs, random sources (e.g., Wogglebug, Marbles), sequencers, or even audio rate signals for “FM” style percussive mayhem.
- **Stacking Utilities:**  
  - Patch the same CV mod source to both DENSITY and FREQ for tempo-synced spectral fireworks.
  - Use manual or CV switching modules to alternate between PUNCH and TAIL modes in real time for telegraphic rhythm-morphing.

---

## 9. **Integrating with Your Rack**

- Use Fracture as a primary rhythmic layer atop simple drum patterns for intricate sparkle.
- Stack multiple Fractures or combine with other granular or percussive sources for the densest polyrhythmic clouds.
- Use clock-multipliers/dividers to drive the module at mathematically related intervals for dense polymetric jams.

---

## 10. **Ideas for Hyper-Complex Sequences**

- **Create custom polyrhythms:**  
  - Drive TRIG with a /5 pattern, TICK with a /7, and ACC with a sequenced accent pattern.
- **Probability & Density Performance:**  
  - Use random/chaos CV sources to automate DENSITY and TAIL.
- **Live Patch Morphing:**  
  - Automate SURFACE and PUNCH for dynamic, ever-changing tone in real time.

---

## Summary

The **WMD Fracture** can be the heart of intricate, living, polyrhythmic percussion—use its dense particle synthesis, wide surface variety, and flexible CV control to generate textures and grooves unattainable with traditional drum voices or samplers. Make every hit, burst, and cluster unique, punchy, and ultra-precise by creatively modulating its controls, using complex gate/trigger patterns, and leveraging its stereo and spatial possibilities.

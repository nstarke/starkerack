### How Autodyne Shapes Hyper-Complex Rhythmic Percussion

Autodyne is not a sound source; rather, it's a highly versatile dynamics processor capable of rhythmically shaping, distorting, and gluing percussion layers. Its ability to contour transients and add punch, along with the filterable sidechain and NY-style blend, makes it especially powerful for dense, rapidly changing rhythmic environments.

#### 1. **Dynamic Polyrhythmic Glue**

- **Insert Autodyne on Your Drum/Multi-Percussion Mix:** Route several percussion voices (e.g. kick, snare/rim, metallic samples) into a submix and process them through Autodyne.
- **Extreme COMPtrol Movement:** Instead of setting and forgetting, **modulate** the COMP parameter with an LFO, envelope follower, or sequencer aligned to a complex or polyrhythmic clock. 
- **Result:** Compression intensity rhythmically ebbs/flows with the meta-patterns in your sequence, creating evolving density and accentuation.

#### 2. **Punch and Snap for Odd-Time Percussion**

- **Use the GAIN as Distortion:** Push the GAIN hard for aggressive, biting sounds, making your drums pop and cut. This works especially well where accents and ghost hits overlap in off-kilter time signatures.
- **Blend Control for Transient Design:** Adjust the BLEND parameter dynamically. For intricate patterns, near-minimum settings let original transients come through; maxed-out brings full squashed-overdrive character. Modulate BLEND to emphasize evolving grooves.

#### 3. **Sidechain Filtering in Poly-Metered Patterns**

- **Multi-Mode Sidechain High Pass Filter:** Remove low-end energy from the sidechain detector to avoid unwanted over-compression during complex, layered kicks or bass.
- **External Sidechain:** Inject another pattern (like a clave, or a different rhythm’s accent track) to make the compressor react in time divisions or polytime. For example, sidechain your 5/8 accent to compress a 7/8 drum loop for complex groove locking and syncopation.

#### 4. **"Rhythmic Pumper" Parallel Compression**

- **Parallel Blend for Groove:** Add 'thwack' and smack to complex hi-hat and rimshot lines by blending unprocessed sharp transients with compressed, fattened sustain. Sweep the blend with random stepped voltages and synced LFOs for a jittery, broken-beat vibe.

#### 5. **Brutal Texture for Percussive FX**

- **Aggressive Modes:** Use full compression plus gain for crushed, broken drum textures reminiscent of glitch or IDM. Process otherwise simple triggers or white noise bursts to generate unique percussive one-shots with dynamically shifting character.
- **Stereo Linking:** Use two Autodynes in parallel for stereo or dual-bus operation. Carefully matched control positions preserve spatial polyrhythmic elements in wider mixes.

#### 6. **Integrating With Modular Sequencers**

- **Sync Compression With Sequencer Steps:** Patch sequencer gates/envelopes to modulate COMP or BLEND at poly-metered rates.
- **Patterned Sidechain Source:** Patch a Euclidean generator, burst generator, or rotating clock divider to the sidechain for 'off-grid' rhythmic pumping not tied strictly to the percussion itself.

### Bonus: Example Patch

1. Send percussion submix (kick, clap, percs in 7/8) → Autodyne input.
2. Set COMP just above center for noticeable pumping.
3. Set GAIN to taste (clean to hard distortion).
4. Enable highpass filter (2nd/3rd slope) to keep kicks punchy.
5. Patch a RANDOM stepped CV (sample & hold) to BLEND, clocked by a divided clock for ever-changing parallel levels.
6. Patch a clave (3/4 time) into the sidechain input—now your 7/8 drums ‘duck’ with a 3/4 clave accent.

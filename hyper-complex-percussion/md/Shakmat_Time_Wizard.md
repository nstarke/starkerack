## Creating Hyper-Complex Rhythmic Percussion with the Shakmat Time Wizard

As a Eurorack modular musician, the **Shakmat Time Wizard** is a powerful ally for generating intricate percussive patterns, polyrhythms, and evolving clock sequences. Here’s how you can harness its magical features to create *densely rhythmic*, *hyper-complex percussion* setups:

### 1. **Polyrhythms and Complex Clock Division**
- **Six Independent Dividers:** Patch your master clock (e.g., from a sequencer or clock source) into the Time Wizard's Clock Input. Each divider (A1–A3, B4–B6) can be independently set to different division factors.
    - Set A1 and B4 to uneven numbers (e.g., 5 and 7). Now A1 and B4 outputs pulse at 1/5 and 1/7 the input clock rate—creating classic polyrhythms.
    - Use even more divisors on the other outs (e.g., 3, 4, 8, 11, 13...) to taste.

### 2. **Complex Time Signatures**
- **Clock B Switch:** Use the Clock B switch to break away from simple divisions. In the lower position, use the Reset/Clock B input as a *completely independent clock* for the B column (B4/5/6). Polyrhythm possibilities multiply when A and B columns run on different clocks!
- **Unusual Bars:** Set the switch to the middle to clock B5/B6 from B4, enabling nested time signatures (e.g., 7/8 over 5/4).

### 3. **Multiplication & Triplets**
- **Multiply A Switch:** Flip to the ×3 or ×4 position to multiply the A column’s clock input frequency—ideal for triplets, dotted notes, or off-grid time slicing. Great for getting that broken, highly syncopated, or ‘rushed’ feel for your percussion voices.

### 4. **Logic Functions: Evolving, Layered Patterns**
- **Logic A2 Switch:** This switch is the rhythmic brain:  
   - "A2 & B5" halves the period at which A2 fires in relation to B5—great for staggered hi-hats or fills.
   - "A2 or A3" generates more *unexpected, offbeat* clock events, great for triggering percussive accents or glitch hits.

### 5. **Reset B6 for Global Structural Changes**
- Use B6’s output to periodically reset the A (or both A+B) columns. This creates bars, cycles, or measure resets, joining disparate rhythms together — very useful for long-form patterns that resolve after many bars.

### 6. **Punchy Percussion via Half Period Gates**
- **Triggers vs. Gates:** On the module’s rear jumper, set outputs 5 & 6 to ‘half period gates’ instead of triggers—some drum modules respond dramatically to gate length, yielding new tonal or shape possibilities per hit.
- **Short Triggers for Snappiness:** For sharp, crisp percussive sounds, use the default short trigger setting on most outputs.

### 7. **General Patch Ideas**
- **Triggering Drum Voices:** Route all six outputs to different drum modules (kick, snare, rim, hat, etc) for wild polyrhythmic patterns.
- **Accent and Flam Effects:** Use logic outputs or multiplied/divided outputs to accent specific percussion hits, drive VCAs for velocity/strength, or layer sounds.
- **Modulating Effects:** Patch outputs to clock a synced delay, stutter, or retrigger in a granular processor for percussive chaos.
- **Probability/Groove:** Use logic combinations (A2 or A3) to add ‘occasionally firing’ triggers—great for fills, funk, and surprise elements.

### 8. **Next-Level Techniques**
- **Stack/Chain Time Wizards:** Combine multiple Time Wizards for truly astronomical complexity.
- **Interact with Resets:** Use the Reset B6 function to periodically shift everything—think complex shifting patterns for IDM, glitch, or experimental techno.

## **Creative Tip**  
Use the Time Wizard as a live performance tool: with the switches and pots at your fingertips, you can morph rhythms on the fly, instantly transforming the mood and energy of your track.

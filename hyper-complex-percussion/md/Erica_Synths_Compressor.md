## Using the Erica Synths Stereo Compressor for Advanced Percussive Rhythm

As a eurorack musician exploring hyper-complex, densely polyrhythmic percussion, the Erica Synths Stereo Compressor is a powerful tool in your effects arsenal. Here’s how you can make the most of its features for intricate percussion-driven music, especially if you’re working with polyrhythms, unusual time signatures, and punchy, high-energy patterns.

### Effect Usage: Stereo Compressor for Complex Percussion

The Erica Synths Stereo Compressor is an effect module, not a voice. It shines by adding punch, presence, and dynamic control to your modular drum and percussion sounds.

#### Key Features Relevant to Percussive Complexity

- **THAT chip-based stereo compression** for professional punch and tightness;
- **DC-coupled sidechain** inputs allow rhythmic animation and ducking;
- **Stereo Link** mode ensures the compressor handles both channels identically, vital for keeping stereo drum content consistent;
- **Threshold, Gain, and Compression Ratio** give you fine control over punch and sustain;
- **Bypass switch** for instant A/B listening and live performance flexibility.

### Approaches for Complex, Punchy Percussion

#### 1. **Polyrhythmic Sidechain Animation**

- Patch a polyrhythmic or polymetric trigger/gate sequence into a VCA or drum voice.
- Send the audio output of that voice into the **Side In L or R** of the Compressor.
- Main drum mix goes into **IN L/R**.
- This enables rhythmic “ducking” based on non-4/4 patterns—each sidechain pulse can follow a completely different groove from your main beat, pushing the rhythmic complexity and making certain elements “breathe” with the pattern.
- **Pro tip:** Use a different, out-of-phase percussive track for the sidechain input to create a counter-rhythm in your dynamics.

#### 2. **Multi-layer Punch and Density**

- Feed layered drum or percussive synth voices into IN L/R.
- Adjust **INPUT LVL** to optimize for punch then dial in **THRESHOLD** low to catch all peaks.
- Set **COMP.AMT (ratio)** high for aggressive squashing, and blend in **GAIN** to bring up room ambience and ghost notes.
- Use the **8-segment VU meter** to visually monitor output and keep levels matched.
- Take advantage of **Stereo Link**: when combining complex panned patterns (say, busy hi-hats left, gritty FM percussion right), enable link to avoid panned “holes” in your groove.

#### 3. **Parallel Compression (NYC/“New York”-Style)**

- Mult or split your drum bus.
- Run one copy through the compressor set for heavy compression (low threshold, high ratio, makeup gain up).
- Blend (using your mixer or VCA) this smashed signal back with the dry to retain transient attack while filling in background details—great for hyperactive, complicated percussion lines.

#### 4. **Live Manipulation and Modulation Tricks**

- Use the **Bypass** switch for live drops and buildups—kill compression for sudden openness, slam it back in for instant tightness.
- Assign CV (via an external VCA or voltage source) to modulate input level or pre-compressor VCA, letting you “ride” dynamics in time with modular events, or even time signatures/phasing shifts.

### Advanced Tips

- **Complex Time Signatures:** Trigger sidechain with polymetric gate sequences (e.g., 7/8 hats sidechain a 4/4 kick). This gives your mix a “breathing” effect that tracks the underlying groove, not the main tempo.
- **Pattern-Synced Compression:** Use Euclidean or burst-based triggers as sidechain input for non-repeating rhythmic pumping.
- **Buffered Sidechain Outs:** Route **SIDE OUT L/R** elsewhere for envelope following, or to control other VCAs or effects in your patch—let your compression rhythmically “talk” to other modules.

## In Summary

This module is not a sound source but dramatically enhances complex percussion patches by making them punchier, tighter, and more unified. Use its stereo compression and sidechain flexibility to create polyrhythmic pumping, advanced groove locking, and dynamic mastery with even the most intricate modular drum tracks.

### Happy patching!

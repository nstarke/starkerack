# **Using Integra Funkitus for Dense, Hyper-Complex Percussion Rhythms**

The **Noise Engineering Integra Funkitus** is a powerful rhythm processor, not a voice or direct effect. Its strength is in combining, modifying, and re-shuffling up to four rhythmic gate/trigger patterns from external sources—perfect for intricate, ever-changing percussion frameworks. Here’s how you can exploit it for dense, polyrhythmic, and adventurous percussive sequences:

---

## **1. Input Preparation: Source of Rhythms**

- **Polyrhythmic Sources:**  
  Feed the 1–4 input jacks with varying rhythm streams, ideally from modules capable of odd meters or polymetric output (e.g., Noise Engineering Numeric Repetitor, Zularic Repetitor, Pamela’s New Workout, Intellijel Steppy, etc.).
- **Time Signature Complexity:**  
  Program your sources so that each input channel runs a different subdivision, pattern length or time signature (e.g., 5/8, 7/16, swing, triplets). This sets the foundation for rich polyrhythmic layering.

---

## **2. Patch Outputs to Distinct Percussion Voices**

- Connect the four output channels to various percussive voices (kick, snare, hats, percussion, glitch modules, etc.).
- Optionally, send some outputs to logic modules or sequential switches for further variation.

---

## **3. Mode Selection & Knob Techniques**

### **Trigger Mode (T)**
- **Knob Function:** Probability that input gate’s *rising edge* triggers an output (the *falling edge* always outputs).
- **Complex Sequences:**  
  - Dial the knobs to mid or low probability for stuttering, unpredictable rhythms.  
  - Use CV on the mod jacks (1–4) to change these probabilities dynamically, synced to LFOs, envelopes, or random sources for ‘living’ patterns.
- **Punchiness Tip:** More sparse triggers for hats with occasional flurries for fills.

### **Gate Mode (G)**
- **Knob Function:** Probability per *both rising and falling edge*; if the falling edge fails, gates can get “stuck” high.
- **Unique Structures:**  
  - Create long, evolving blocks of gates—excellent for chopped, gated percussion or surprise long hits (good for “wooosh” cymbal or noise-based percs).
  - Drastically increases rhythmic density if set to higher probabilities.
- **Percussive Texture:** Use for stretched claps, snares, or other long percs that benefit from nonstandard lengths.

### **Logic Mode (L)**
- **Knob Function:** Crossfades from solo input (full CCW), to increasingly combined logic outputs per channel (with full CW muting the channel).
- **Hyper-Complexity:**  
  - Blend several rhythm sources into ever-evolving meta-patterns.  
  - Send CV to the knob inputs for dynamic, organic re-patching (e.g., add LFOs for slow blends, random for wild shifts).
- **Note:** Full CW = mute; use for dropouts/breakdowns at a twist.

---

## **4. Burn Function: Instant Fills & Chaos**

- Engage **Burn** to instantly sum all inputs to all outputs.  
- Use this for dense fills, glitchy breakdowns, or sudden barrages of percussion—perfect for shifting into maximalist textures.

---

## **5. Tips and Advanced Patch Ideas**

- **Chaotic CV Modulation:**  
  Use complex modulation (random, S&H, envelopes from your main voice modules, etc.) to modulate the mod jacks. This causes the rhythm logic itself to morph in real time.
- **Layered Fills:**  
  Combine Burn momentarily with re-patched L-mode to make “all-in” sequences for short intervals.
- **Unusual Signatures:**  
  Feed in Euclidean polyrhythms or rhythmic streams in uncommon signatures for relentless unpredictability.
- **Route Outputs Through Slew/Envelope:**  
  Post-process gates into envelopes for non-standard ‘soft-attacked’ percussive shapes.

---

## **6. General Percussive Manipulation**

- **Accent Creation:**  
  Mix outputs into a VCA, let only some pass through based on additional random logic or manually switch sequences in performance.
- **Unique Voice Treatment:**  
  Patch to percussive effect modules (distortion, wavefolder, LPG) after Integra Funkitus for sharper, “punched up” textures.  
  Crossfade or combine several processed outputs for super-dense layers.

---

## **Summary**

The Integra Funkitus is ideal for:
- Creating multilayered, polymetric rhythms.
- Patching super-dense and unpredictable percussion sequences.
- Live manipulation and dramatic fills using Burn/Logic/CV-modded probability.
- Re-wiring your entire groove structure from simple gate/trig inputs.

Use it as a *rhythm mutator* in your modular system—and let your drum patterns continually evolve, never repeating in the same way twice!

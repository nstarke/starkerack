# Using the 7Path - Ethernet Patch Cable Bridge for Hyper Complex Rhythmic Eurorack Patching

The **7Path** module is not a sound generator or an effect; it is a clever utility that allows you to route up to 7 signals between two physical locations in your modular setup using a single Ethernet cable. This makes it a powerful organizational and creative tool for advanced rhythmic and polyrhythmic patching. Here’s how you can leverage this in the pursuit of dense, complex percussive sequences:

## Creative Uses for Hyper Complex Rhythms & Percussion

### 1. **Patch Dense Trigger/Clock Networks Between Cases**
- **Scenario:** You have multiple cases (or multiple hands-on areas within a huge case), each with sequencers, clock dividers, logic modules, and drum voices.
- **Technique:** Route triggers, clocks, resets, and CVs for rhythms through the 7Path. For instance:
    - Send several different clock divisions and polyrhythmic triggers from one case/sequencer to another without crossing your entire rig with long patch cables.
    - Sequence ‘A’ in case one can trigger percussion voices in case two, while CV modulation floats the other direction, enabling very non-local and complex interaction.

### 2. **Facilitate Polyrhythmic Pattern Generation**
- **Scenario:** Want to intertwine different time signatures or create evolving, complex patterns?
- **Technique:** Use clock generators or sequencers producing 5/4, 7/8, etc., and send these as individual triggers via the 7Path to distant modules.
    - Route a Euclidean sequencer’s polyrhythmic outputs to multiple drum voices far away in your setup, letting their complexity cross-pollinate other timing systems.

### 3. **Distributed Logic for Advanced Rhythms**
- **Scenario:** Using logic modules (AND, OR, XOR) to combine rhythmic gates and triggers.
- **Technique:** Patch logic outputs or inputs from logic modules on one side of your system through 7Path to interact with sequencers, dividers, and drum modules elsewhere. This is especially good for:
    - Muting/unmuting layers by remote logic gates.
    - Combining triggers from spatially separated sources for surprise polyphonic percussion hits.

### 4. **Complex FX Routing for Percussion**
- **Scenario:** Manipulate percussive voices or CV with unique and punchy effects.
- **Technique:** Use 7Path to route dynamic envelopes, LFOs, or stepped random CV from complex modulation generators in one case to VCFs, VCAs, or distortions processing drum voices in another. Introduce cross-case sidechaining or ducking.

### 5. **Instant Re-Patching, Modular ‘Scene’ Changes**
- **Scenario:** Need rapid re-routing without the cable mess, improvising live or in the studio.
- **Technique:** Keep the 7Path “bus” as your main bridge—quickly shift what signals travel through its 7 lines to completely reshape groove and density on the fly, swapping trigger routings for fresh percussive interplay.

## Workflow Example:

**Case A:** Dedicated to complex rhythm gen (Pam’s New Workout, Ornament & Crime in Sequencer mode, Logic Modules).

**Case B:** Drum voices, percussive synths, and FX based percussion (filters, wavefolders, VCAs with short envelopes).

- Use 7Path to send:
    1. Two polyrhythmic triggers (say, a 5-step and a 7-step Euclidean).
    2. Clock divider’s triplet output.
    3. Random stepped CV for pitch/articulation.
    4. Envelope from Case A for accent or punch.
- Receive in Case B:
    - Route all 7 inputs to different percussion voices, or mix and match using stackables and logic to hybridize dense patterns.
    - Feedback: Send a percussive accent or effect send trigger *back* through a different 7Path channel, creating a feedback control loop.

## Why This Is Uniquely Powerful

- **No Signal Restriction:** Any type of eurorack signal can be routed (triggers, gates, audio, CV).
- **1-to-1 Mapping:** Patch input #4 on one, get the output on #4 at the other—super predictable for fast, performative workflow.
- **No Power Required:** Passive, small, and doesn’t eat up headers or case power budget.
- **Organizational Tool:** Reduces cable clutter, especially with dense rhythmic patching, making setup and teardown less stressful and highly modular in the literal sense.

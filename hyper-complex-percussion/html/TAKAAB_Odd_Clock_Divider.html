<h1>Using the Takaab OCD Odd Clock Divider for Complex Percussion and Polyrhythms</h1>
<p>The <strong>Takaab OCD</strong> is not a sound/voice or effect module but a <strong>2HP clock divider</strong> specializing in odd and less common rhythmic divisions. As a rhythmic utility, it is a powerful tool for generating intricate, interlocking patterns required in advanced percussion programming and modular polyrhythmic sequencing.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to Use the OCD For Dense and Complex Rhythms</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Generating Diverse Clock Streams (Odd Divisions)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The OCD outputs simultaneous gate pulses from a single clock input at:</li>
<li><strong>/3</strong></li>
<li><strong>/5</strong></li>
<li><strong>/7</strong></li>
<li><strong>/9</strong> (can be changed to <strong>/6</strong> via jumper)</li>
<li><strong>/10</strong><br />
Each output provides a mathematically related rhythmic subdivision that does not conform to typical duple/quad patterns, making every stream "offset" and polyrhythmic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Synchronizing Unrelated Patterns</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Patch different outputs to trigger various percussion modules—each one gets its own unique, cycling rhythm, often lining up only after several cycles (true polyrhythm).</li>
<li>Example:  <ul>
<li>/3 ⟶ Kick  </li>
<li>/5 ⟶ Snare  </li>
<li>/7 ⟶ Hihat  </li>
<li>/9 ⟶ Perc  </li>
<li>/10 ⟶ Clap</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Complex Time Signatures</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mix odd dividers (/5, /7, /9) with even dividers (use Takaab ECD for /2, /4, /6, /8, etc.) to build patterns in time signatures uncommon in typical Western music (e.g., 5/8, 7/8, 9/16, etc.).</li>
<li>Chain/ping sequencers and algorithmic generators (like Euclidean or logic modules) with OCD outputs to create time signatures that morph and phase over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Rhythmic Accents and Reset Function</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>RESET input or button</strong>:  </li>
<li>Send manual/automated triggers (from a master clock, LFO, or any musical event) to RESET to realign all patterns, creating cycles of tension/release and evolving rhythmic frameworks.</li>
<li>Resets serve as metric “glue” for live performances and improvisational structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Duty Cycle Shaping</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>All outputs have a 50% duty cycle (1:1 high:low, rounded to nearest input pulse), but ratios vary slightly with odd-number divisions (e.g., 1/3 = 1:3, 1/7 = 3:4):</li>
<li>These unconventional gate lengths create nonstandard envelope shapes if patched directly to percussive voices with voltage-controlled elements (VCAs, LPGs, sample/holds).</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Patch Tips for Hyper-Complex Percussion</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layering Clocks:</strong> Use multiple OCD units normalizing RESET/CLOCK inputs to keep many polyrhythmic divisions tightly phase-locked but out of conventional sync (using the included 2-pin Dupont jumpers).</li>
<li><strong>Logic Modules:</strong> Combine different OCD outputs via OR, XOR, AND, or sequential switch modules to create new, emergent rhythms and nested tuplets not available from a single divider.</li>
<li><strong>Step Sequencer Modulation:</strong> Clock step sequencers or trigger selectors with OCD outs for constantly shifting step patterns, shuffling through different percussion samples, or changing modulation destinations to build evolving polyrhythms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Example Patch Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Polyrhythmic Percussion Engine:</strong><br />
  Clock input = 120 BPM master clock.<br />
  OCD /3 out → kick drum trigger <br />
  OCD /5 out → snare trigger<br />
  OCD /7 out → hi-hat envelope<br />
  OCD /9 out → random sample drum sound<br />
  OCD /10 out → fill/FX percussion  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Polytemporal Sequencing:</strong><br />
  Patch clocked sequencers or random voltage sources with various OCD outs to melody and modulation destinations for metric modulation of both pitch and percussive voices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rhythmic Reset FX:</strong><br />
  Automate the RESET (with a random generator, slow LFO, or hand-button) for "rhythmic jump-cuts," re-aligning complex layers on-the-fly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Bonus: Modulate Odd Divisions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jumper to switch 1/9 to 1/6:</strong><br />
  Patch with the Takaab UXS or use the jumper on the board to shift the behaviour of this output—consider this during a performance for sudden time signature/feel changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>While the OCD is not a sound source or effect by itself, <strong>it is an advanced, compact utility</strong> that, especially in combination with other sequencers, dividers, logic modules, and percussion voices, serves as the rhythmic backbone for modular setups that aim for density, complexity, and organic, ever-evolving pattern generation. It excels at <strong>polyrhythmic sequencing</strong>, <strong>complex time signatures</strong>, and <strong>rhythmic modulations</strong>—all hallmarks of cutting-edge modular percussion.</p>

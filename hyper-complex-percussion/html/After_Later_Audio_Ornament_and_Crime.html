<h1>Ornament &amp; Crime for Hyper-Complex, Densely Rhythmic Percussion</h1>
<p>Ornament &amp; Crime (O_C) is exceptionally suited for creative rhythmic architectures: advanced polyrhythms, odd time signatures, Euclidean sequencing, and self-mutating patterns. While not a "voice" or "effect" module in the traditional sense, O_C becomes a powerful rhythmic engine/triggers brain or a “musical modulation” generator, ideal for sophisticated percussion sequencing. Here’s how to exploit it for densely rhythmic and hyper-complex percussion:</p>
<hr />
<h2>Strategy: Use O_C as a Rhythmic Brain for Percussion</h2>
<p>Rather than producing sounds directly, O_C spits out precisely controlled and wildly evolving CV/gate streams. Route these outputs to drum voices, percussion modules, sample players, or any CV/gate sources to drive rich rhythmic interplay. Chain, cross-patch, or layer with other sequencers for utter rhythmic mayhem or structure.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Best O_C Apps for Advanced Rhythms</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Piqued (Quad Voltage-Controlled Envelope/Trigger Generator w/ Euclidean/Polyrhythms)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Euclidean Trigger Filters:</strong> Turn each channel into a polyrhythmic/Euclidean trigger and envelope generator.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern Length, Fill, and Rotation:</strong> Per-channel control of how often an envelope fires within a set length—perfect for complex polyrhythms (e.g. 5 in 8, 3 in 7, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Variable Envelope Shapes</strong>: Make your drum triggers not just gates but custom-shaped envelopes (very punchy, or slow ramps for “fuzzy” percussion).</li>
<li><strong>Looping/Burst Mode</strong>: Use the envelope looping/ratcheting for fast rolls, bursts, retriggering hi-hats, or glitchy hats.</li>
<li><strong>CV Control</strong>: Sequence or modulate envelope parameters for constant evolution/“mutation”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Ideas:</strong>
- <em>Euclidean Triggers</em>: Channel A = Kicks (5 in 8), B = Snares (3 in 8), C = Claps (7 in 13), D = Perc Hits (2 in 9).
- <em>Envelope Loops</em>: Self-retrigger envelopes for rapid burst percussion.
- <em>Randomize</em>: Modulate Euclidean parameters or envelope durations with LFO/CV for shifting grooves.
- <em>Chained Envelopes</em>: Use end-of-cycle (EOC) as triggers for other envelopes (drum fills that trigger new hits).</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>2. Dialectic Ping Pong (Bouncing Ball Envelopes for Chaotic Percussion)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Simulates physics of bouncing balls</em>—inherently non-grid, evolving rhythmic trigger/gate sequences.</li>
<li><em>Control initial amplitude, gravity, “bounce loss”, retrigger count—ideal for swinging, accelerating, decelerating percussion patterns.</em></li>
<li>Great for flams, fills, fills, rolls, and “organic” ever-mutating percussive movement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Idea:</strong> Use several channels with different gravities and loss to trigger “drunken” percussion.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Sequins (Dual 4x16-Step Sequencer with Pattern Chaining, Direction, Probability, Randomness)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Chain patterns together for extremely long/complex sequences.</em></li>
<li><em>Any channel can be clocked by a different clock for ratio-based polyrhythms (e.g., one at 9 triggers, the other at 8).</em></li>
<li><em>Direction: random, pendulum, Brownian motion: introduces variation and anti-repetitive rhythms.</em></li>
<li><em>CV addressing: CV controls step position for non-linear drum triggering (e.g. live modulation of sequence steps).</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>4. Piqued + Sequins Hybrid</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use Sequins CV outputs to modulate envelope length, fill amount, or step count on Piqued, turning your percussion lines into evolving, self-mutating polyrhythmic monsters.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>5. Meta-Q (Quantizer with Scale/Mask/Step Sequencing)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use dual quantizers to mangle drum pitch, or—by feeding stepped modulation from an LFO or random source—send irregular clocking/gates to percussion modules.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>6. Harrington 1200 / Automatonnetz (Chord &amp; Transformation Triggering)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Euclidean trigger masks per transformation (PLR/NSH)</em>: Not limited to melody—use to gate percussive elements with logic or sequential “rhythmic chord changes”.</li>
<li><em>Programmable transformation order/priority gives shifting accents and “hiccuping” patterns.</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>7. Viznutcracker, sweet! (ByteBeat)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Bytebeats can be clocked by external or Euclidean triggers—use them as CV for drum parameter “glitch FX” or (with slew/quantize) as unpredictable stepped mod signals.</em></li>
<li><em>Audio-rate bytebeats patched into a VCA/Filter, triggered by rhythmic envelopes, become abrasive percussion blocks.</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Making Percussion Unique, Punchy, and Percussive</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dynamic Envelope Shaping:</strong> In Piqued, modulate attack/release/shape per striking event for every hit to be slightly different—keeps percussion from sounding static.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Envelope Modulation for "Punch":</strong> Short snappy attack, variable decay and amplitude (modulate with sequencers/LFO for “living” drums).</li>
<li><strong>Self-modulation:</strong> Patch O_C outputs to your drum modules, and route their envelope (or amplitude) CV out back into O_C’s CV inputs for auto-evolving rhythms.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Channel Triggering/Chaining</strong>: Chain EOC to trigger other envelopes for layered percussion, micro-fills, or ghost notes.</li>
<li><strong>Ratchets and Burst Envelopes:</strong> Use Piqued’s max loops + retrig envelopes for ratchets/trills—great for hats, snare rolls, or machine-gun fills.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Shapes:</strong> Use “wiggle” and “dipper” shapes for more organic percussive envelopes, or Gate shape for hard-edged triggers.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Patch Tips for Complex Polyrhythms</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Clocks:</strong> Feed separate, non-multiplicative clocks to each O_C channel.</li>
<li><strong>Euclidean Mode Everywhere:</strong> Dissimilar pattern lengths &amp; fills per channel = layers of poly-metre, always shifting.</li>
<li><strong>External Modulation:</strong> Modulate Euclidean fills/offsets with slow LFOs, stepped CVs, or even other O_C channels for algorithmic, never-repeating patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Brownian/Rnd Directions:</strong> Let patterns “walk” or “jump” randomly for controlled chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope/Gate Logic:</strong> Sum, XOR, or logic-combine envelope outs for even denser triggers.</li>
<li><strong>Chain O_C with Sequential Switch or Matrix:</strong> Route these rhythms dynamically to different voices, drums, or FX for "live remixing".</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Exploiting Output Uniqueness</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drum Voice Pitch/Bend/Fx:</strong> Use O_C’s evolving envelopes/CVs to modulate pitch, filter, decay, overdrive, or wavetable position in drum and percussion voices.</li>
<li><strong>Bytebeat Glitches:</strong> Use Viznutcracker’s audio outs for digital “clap” or “noise” components, filter heavily, and mix with regular drums for one-of-a-kind hits.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Practical Application Example</h2>
<p><strong>Patch: Polyrhythmic Euclidean Drum Machine</strong>
1. Set Piqued Channel A: Euclidean (5 fills, 7 steps, offset 0)—to trigger Kick.
2. Channel B: (13, 16, 3)—Snare.
3. Channel C: (7, 9, 2)—Clap/Conga.
4. Channel D: (3, 5, 0)—Hi-Hat, with looping AD envelope.
5. Modulate fill and offset with slow LFOs or random CV.
6. Use Sequins to modulate Piqued’s envelope length/randomness per hit.
7. Crosspatch EOC from one envelope as retrigger to another for microfills.
8. Send Bytebeat or Lorenz attractor out to modulate filter/decay/pitch for accent and random FX.</p>

<h2>Using HEXvca for Dense, Complex Rhythmic &amp; Percussive Patches</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bubblesound HEXvca</strong> is a six-channel voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) with flexible normalization, mix outputs, linear/exponential switching, and DC-coupled inputs for both audio and CV. While it is not a voice or effect on its own, it is an <strong>essential utility for routing, sculpting, and animating both audio and control voltages</strong>—especially potent in dense, polyrhythmic, and complex percussion setups. Here’s how to exploit its strengths:</p>
<h3>1. Modular Polyrhythmic Percussion Routing</h3>
<h4>a. <strong>Assigning VCAs to Percussion Voices</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Route six different percussive sound sources (drums, metallic hits, noise bursts, modular drum synths) into the six HEXvca inputs.</li>
<li>Patch separate or shared envelopes/LFOs/gate bursts to their respective CV inputs.</li>
<li>Use the jumpers on the back to normalize CVs, allowing one gate or envelope to trigger multiple VCAs for tightly related patterns or "flams."</li>
</ul>
<h4>b. <strong>Complex Accent Patterns (using the Exp/Linear Switches)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Assign different VCA response curves: Use exponential for snappier transients (kicks/snares), linear for smoother hits (hats, shakers).</li>
<li>Modulate the CV with rhythmic LFOs, stepped random voltages, or Euclidean/chaotic gates for organic, “swung” micro-timing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>c. <strong>Creating Polyrhythms &amp; Unusual Rhythmic Structures</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Feed in multiple complex rhythmic control voltages (such as from a trigger sequencer or random CV generator) into different VCAs’ CV inputs.</li>
<li>Use cross-normalization jumpers so a single polyrhythmic CV can gate multiple percussive voices at offset rhythms—ideal for 5-against-7 time, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>2. Using the Built-in Mixer for Rhythmic Layering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Utilize the <strong>1-3, 4-6, and 1-6 mix outputs</strong> to blend clusters of percussive voices into “macro” percussion channels.</li>
<li>Apply different CV patterns to overlapping groups (for example, channels 1, 3, 5 running in 7/8; 2, 4, 6 in 5/4) and sum to the main mix for composite polyrhythms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>3. Dynamic, Punchy Percussive Manipulation</h3>
<h4>a. <strong>Rhythmic Gating and Chopping</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Use short, sharp envelopes or triggers to “chop” sounds for hyper-articulated rhythms or glitch percussion.</li>
<li>Try 1V/oct or sequencer gates into the CV inputs for “melodic” gating or accent randomization.</li>
</ul>
<h4>b. <strong>Crossfade Percussive Textures</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch two or three sources (e.g., metallic digital drum, saturated analog hit, noise burst) into adjacent VCAs, using their VCAs’ CVs to rhythmically blend and morph textures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>4. Make it Unique, Punchy, and Percussive</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use very short, high-voltage envelopes for instant “thwack”; modulate amplitude dynamically with random or cyclical CV for an organic, always-shifting groove.</li>
<li>Patch CV into both the input and CV of a VCA for amplitude-modulated AM/ringmod-style percussive clangs (DC-coupled design supports audio-rate CV for wild effects).</li>
<li>Try signal path “feedback” by routing the mixer output back into an audio input (careful with gain staging) for smashed, dirty parallel compression effects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>5. Pro-level Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>SSM2164 VVCA chips</strong> deliver super low noise and headroom—so don’t be afraid to run hot transient signals for crisp punch.</li>
<li>The module is only 7HP: Use multiple HEXvcas in a single skiff for high-density rhythmic matrixing.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The HEXvca is more than a utility; in a dense rhythmic patch, it becomes a core tool for sculpting, gating, accenting, layering, and dynamically remixing percussion. It’s at its most powerful when paired with sequencer gates, complex clocks, random CV, and multichannel envelopes/LFOs. Use the normalization and built-in mixer to wring maximal complexity and “liveness” from your patch.</p>

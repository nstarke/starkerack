<h2>Using 2hp Rout for Hyper-Complex Percussion and Rhythmic Patterns</h2>
<p><strong>2hp Rout</strong> is a voltage-controlled gate/trigger switch that routes one input to one of four outputs, under manual or CV control. While simple in concept, it is <em>highly</em> potent for generative, polymetric, and polyrhythmic architectures.</p>
<p>Below are advanced, musical strategies for leveraging Rout to build dense, intricate percussion and rhythm:</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. <strong>Polyrhythmic Trigger Distribution</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clock Dividers/Multipliers:</strong> Inject a high-speed master clock or polymetric trigger train from a sequencer or clock module (like Pamela’s NEW Workout or Tempi) into Rout’s INPUT. Use several independent clock divisions (e.g., /3, /5, /7) as modulation sources patched to <strong>SEL CV</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Rout dynamically re-routes a single, fast fluid rhythm into four destination voices or percussion modules, according to the interplay of several unrelated rhythms, creating emergent polyrhythms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>2. <strong>Complex Time Signature Sequencing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step Sequence the Rout Selection:</strong> Use a voltage sequencer (e.g., Make Noise Pressure Points, Malekko Voltage Block) clocked in a complex time signature (e.g., 7/8, 5/4, or Euclidean patterns) to supply changing voltages to <strong>SEL CV</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> The switching logic splits a main sequence, reassigning individual trigger/gate steps to different percussion voices, allowing you to cycle through “odd” patterns across a four-voice drum kit.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>3. <strong>Algorithmic or Generative Drumming</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Randomized/Probabilistic Routing:</strong> Patch a stepped random voltage (e.g., Wogglebug, Pamela’s Random, or Sapèl) to <strong>SEL CV</strong>. The random CV causes Rout to bounce the same trigger to various destinations unpredictably—fantastic for glitch, IDM, breakcore, or evolving machine music.</li>
<li><strong>CV Quantization:</strong> Use a CV quantizer on <strong>SEL CV</strong> to keep output switching snappy and rhythmically aligned.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>4. <strong>Pattern Variation &amp; Fills</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a manual offset voltage as a “fill” or “break” selector—add an offset from a fader, joystick, or a footswitch to force Rout to select a particular output (e.g., a snare fill or rim hit).</li>
<li>Employ logic modules or comparators to toggle Rout’s selection on-the-fly, injecting burst energy during particular sections.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>5. <strong>Multi-Voice Percussion Engine</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Send a single dynamically evolving gate/trigger pattern into Rout’s INPUT.</li>
<li>Route outputs to four distinct percussive modules (kick, snare, hi-hat, and percussion voice).</li>
<li>By modulating <strong>SEL CV</strong> rapidly, you can "jump-cut" different percussion modules’ hits from a single rhythm, building stuttered, fractured, and intricate beat structures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>6. <strong>Creative Effects Routing (if patched with effect units)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live FX Chopper:</strong> You can gate on/off effects by sending gates or audio pulses through Rout, switching between four different FX chains or parallel processing paths in sync with the rhythm.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong><em>Quick Tip</em></strong>:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Envelope Synchronicity:</strong> Use Rout to send triggers to envelope generators that control percussive synth voices with different decay, wavefolding, or filter characteristics per channel for extremely varied and punchy output.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Perceptual Punch</em></strong>:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exploit Rout’s abrupt switching for “machine gun” fills or polymetered gate overlaps—combine with analog processing (VCAs, filters, wavefolders) downstream for even greater punch and timbral variety.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Patch Example</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> High-paced Euclidean or binary trigger from a clock/module.</li>
<li><strong>SEL CV:</strong> Complex voltage pattern from a sequencer or random stepped voltage.</li>
<li><strong>Outputs 1-4:</strong> Trigger four distinct percussive voices or drum modules.</li>
<li><strong>(Optional):</strong> Route CVable parameters (timbre, decay, pitch) of your drum modules to dynamic gates for wild sonic movement.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>By cleverly sequencing and CV-modulating the output selector, <strong>Rout</strong> becomes a backbone for hyper-rhythmic, unpredictable, and intricate musical systems that are always evolving.</p>

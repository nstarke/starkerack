<h2>Generating Hyper Complex Percussion and Rhythms with the ADDAC506</h2>
<p>The <strong>ADDAC506 VC Stochastic Function Generator &amp; Expansion</strong> is a powerhouse for crafting densely rhythmic and hyper complex percussion sequences in your Eurorack setup. Here’s how you can exploit its features to make polyrhythmic, multi-timbral, and idiosyncratic percussion:</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>1. Use All Four Channels Independently for Polyrhythms</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four Independent Envelopes</strong>: Each channel acts as a function generator/envelope that can be triggered or slewed by independent sources.</li>
<li><strong>Unsynced Cycles</strong>: Trigger channels using unrelated or clock-divided gate/triggers, causing each envelope to loop at different rates. This immediately creates polyrhythms and cross-rhythms.</li>
<li><strong>External Randomization (Expansion)</strong>: Use the Expansion’s RANDOM TRIGGER inputs to re-randomize envelope times mid-cycle for bursts, fills, and unexpected time changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>2. Embrace Complexity with Stochastic Rise/Fall Times</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variable RISE/FALL Minimum &amp; Maximum</strong>: Set each channel’s RISE and FALL min/max to different, musically meaningful ranges (e.g., one short, one long, one medium, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Randomization per Trigger</strong>: Each new trigger/loop chooses a new envelope time within set limits, resulting in constantly shifting, non-repeating patterns. Modulate min &amp; max with CV for evolving polyrhythmic envelopes.</li>
<li><strong>Lock Feature</strong>: Lock certain channels to “freeze” a rhythm, then unlock and modify others for very intentional variability in patterns.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Exploit Loop/One-Shot and Gate/Trigger/Slew Behavior</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loop Mode</strong>: Use some channels as looping envelopes and others as one-shots to overlay static time signatures with freeform or stochastic elements.</li>
<li><strong>Slew Mode</strong>: Slew can turn stepped voltage sequences (like LFOs or random CVs) into percussive envelope shapes, following CV inputs in a unique, organic way. Great for anti-clock “ratcheting” percussive effects or unexpected swells.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>4. Gate &amp; EOR/EOF Outputs for Complicated Triggers</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gate Outs</strong>: Use the GATE OUT during the “rise” segment to define gate length; patch these to drum modules, VCAs, or hit/reset/clock inputs of other sequencers or digital modules for off-grid triggers.</li>
<li><strong>EOR/EOF</strong>: Use these outputs for meta-patterns – patch them to other envelope triggers, clocks, or sequential switches to create generation-on-generation polyrhythms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>5. Modulate Everything for “Living” Percussion</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CV Control Over Everything</strong>: Feed LFOs, stepped modulations, random CV, or even audio-rate signals to RISE/FALL min or max, amplitude, offset, and curve parameters. Your envelopes become meta-instruments, responding dynamically in highly nuanced ways.</li>
<li><strong>Curve Control (LIN/LOG)</strong>: Morph between linear and logarithmic curves for each envelope to get snappier, more articulate “attack” phases or slow, booming decays—turning basic envelopes into a rich palette of percussion energies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>6. Summed &amp; Averaged Mix Outs for Layering</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SUM/AVERAGE Outputs</strong>: Use the sum or average of all 4 envelopes mixed together as a multi-layered modulation source—excellent for modulating filters, FX sends, or even as the master VCA envelope for a drum mix bus.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>7. Unique Percussive Voice Design</strong></h3>
<p>If using the outputs as voices:
- <strong>Ping “Analog” Percussion Circuits</strong>: Patch envelope outs directly to resonant filters, LPGs, or dedicated analog drum circuits for wildly unique percussive pings and thwacks.
- <strong>Punch &amp; Character</strong>: Modulate amplitude and offset for each percussive hit. Pair with non-linear curves for snap. Try extreme settings to get glitchy, hyperactive digital artifacts.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Patch Examples</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Meta-Polyrhythm Patch</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>ENVELOPE 1: Set to fast loop, RISE/FALL random range narrow (5–50 ms), into hat module trigger input</li>
<li>ENVELOPE 2: Medium loop, wide random range, into snare trigger</li>
<li>ENVELOPE 3: Triggered from an external rhythm generator, used as a complex modulation source for a drum synth’s pitch or filter</li>
<li>ENVELOPE 4: One-shot mode with stochastic Rise, to play on “off-beat” kicks or FM percussion</li>
<li>Use SUM/AVG out to modulate a send effect amount for all drums or drive a resonant LPG for pseudo stereo panning.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Final Tips</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Always experiment with cross-patching random outputs, EOR/EOF, and random triggers.</li>
<li>Morph CV and amplitude throughout a performance for evolving, living rhythms.</li>
<li>The stochastic re-triggering means no two bars will ever be identical—harness this for unpredictable, intricate sequences.</li>
</ul>

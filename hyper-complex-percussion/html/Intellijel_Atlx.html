<h2>Using the <strong>Atlx</strong> (Atlantix Expander) for Dense, Hyper-Complex Percussion &amp; Rhythmic Patching</h2>
<p>The <strong>Atlx</strong> is an expander for the Intellijel <strong>Atlantix</strong> dual oscillator/subtractive synth voice, primarily adding 16 extra jacks including independent waveform and filter outs, and a built-in ring modulator. While not a dedicated rhythm generator or trigger sequencer, <strong>the Atlx and Atlantix combo can be pushed into advanced percussive territory with creative patching</strong>:</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. <strong>Patch Individual Waveforms for Percussive Layering</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated outs</strong> for both A and B oscillators (Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square w/PWM on A, Sub Square on A) allow you to:<ul>
<li>Patch each waveform to different VCAs/Filters for separate dynamic envelope control.</li>
<li>Layer multiple rapid VCO “clicks” and “thumps” as drum-voice elements (e.g., Triangle for kick, Square for snare body).</li>
<li><strong>Complex Percussion Tip:</strong> Cross-patch envelopes and LFOs to VCO pitch or pulse width for FM "snap" or transients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Advanced Filtering for Sculpting Rhythmic Timbres</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter outs</strong> (Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Phazor):<ul>
<li>Send different waveforms to different filter outputs; sequence or randomly switch between them for morphing drum timbres.</li>
<li>Stack filter outputs into VCAs with independent envelopes for layered, shifting percussion.</li>
<li>Automate the routing of filters for dynamic patterning, even mid-pattern, for polyrhythmic timbral changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Ring Modulator Magic</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The on-board <strong>ring modulator (RING Out)</strong> can be fed oscillator A and B (X and Y IN) or <em>anything</em> in your rack:<ul>
<li>Ring mod is classic for metallic, clangorous sounds (think hi-hats, cymbals).</li>
<li>Modulate one oscillator at audio or LFO rates, or try audio input plus LFO for moving/chaotic metallic percussion.</li>
<li>Even send rhythmic CV or clock bursts into one input for AM/rhythmic gating effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Polyrhythmic/Complex Sequencing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not a sequencer itself, but the expander makes the Atlantix voice* far more patchable:</strong><ul>
<li>Use external sequencers with per-step outputs controlling oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, VCA amplitude, or PWM for evolving, unpredictable percussion.</li>
<li>Self-patch outputs back into modulation inputs (example: Sub osc out to filter CV, or filter out to FM in) for chaotic, complex patterns that “play themselves.”</li>
<li>Patch envelopes or LFOs clocked/divided/multiplied by odd intervals for polyrhythmic modulations (e.g., trig env A at 4, env B at 7).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Punchiness and Uniqueness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>VCA drive circuit</strong> in Atlantix for analog saturation on percussive hits—punchier kicks, claps, or snares.</li>
<li>Modulate oscillator sync, filter resonance, or ring mod X/Y inputs with rhythmic pulses or random gates for “glitch” or “granular” percussion.</li>
<li>Highly parameterize envelopes for snappy, clicky, or long decaying drum elements.</li>
<li>Experiment with patching sub-oscillator, ring mod, or phazored outputs into effects or external resonators for more attack or “body.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Example Patch: Polyrhythmic Layered Drum Sequence</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Osc A Triangle</strong> → VCA 1 (envelope from sequencer channel 1, 5/8 pattern) → Filter Lowpass out.</li>
<li><strong>Osc B Square</strong> → VCA 2 (envelope from sequencer channel 2, 7/8 pattern) → Filter Bandpass out.</li>
<li><strong>Sub Square A</strong> → VCA 3 (quick decay envelope, 3-step rotating clock) → Ring Mod Y input.</li>
<li><strong>Ring Mod Out</strong> → additional VCA (snappy envelope; use this as "hi-hat" or clave).</li>
<li><strong>Mix filter outs</strong> for composite percussion, multi-VCA mixing, or pan each to a different FX channel for maximum dynamism.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Modulate oscillator pitch, filter cutoff, or PWM at audio rates from other rhythmic modules to create unpredictable, “broken” beats.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Atlx unlocks Atlantix for multi-layered, hybrid drum voices with tight, patchable integration. It excels with creative modulation, layering, and self-patching—invaluable for complex polyrhythmic music!</em></p>

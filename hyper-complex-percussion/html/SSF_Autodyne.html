<h3>How Autodyne Shapes Hyper-Complex Rhythmic Percussion</h3>
<p>Autodyne is not a sound source; rather, it's a highly versatile dynamics processor capable of rhythmically shaping, distorting, and gluing percussion layers. Its ability to contour transients and add punch, along with the filterable sidechain and NY-style blend, makes it especially powerful for dense, rapidly changing rhythmic environments.</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Dynamic Polyrhythmic Glue</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insert Autodyne on Your Drum/Multi-Percussion Mix:</strong> Route several percussion voices (e.g. kick, snare/rim, metallic samples) into a submix and process them through Autodyne.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme COMPtrol Movement:</strong> Instead of setting and forgetting, <strong>modulate</strong> the COMP parameter with an LFO, envelope follower, or sequencer aligned to a complex or polyrhythmic clock. </li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Compression intensity rhythmically ebbs/flows with the meta-patterns in your sequence, creating evolving density and accentuation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. <strong>Punch and Snap for Odd-Time Percussion</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use the GAIN as Distortion:</strong> Push the GAIN hard for aggressive, biting sounds, making your drums pop and cut. This works especially well where accents and ghost hits overlap in off-kilter time signatures.</li>
<li><strong>Blend Control for Transient Design:</strong> Adjust the BLEND parameter dynamically. For intricate patterns, near-minimum settings let original transients come through; maxed-out brings full squashed-overdrive character. Modulate BLEND to emphasize evolving grooves.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. <strong>Sidechain Filtering in Poly-Metered Patterns</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Mode Sidechain High Pass Filter:</strong> Remove low-end energy from the sidechain detector to avoid unwanted over-compression during complex, layered kicks or bass.</li>
<li><strong>External Sidechain:</strong> Inject another pattern (like a clave, or a different rhythm’s accent track) to make the compressor react in time divisions or polytime. For example, sidechain your 5/8 accent to compress a 7/8 drum loop for complex groove locking and syncopation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. <strong>"Rhythmic Pumper" Parallel Compression</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel Blend for Groove:</strong> Add 'thwack' and smack to complex hi-hat and rimshot lines by blending unprocessed sharp transients with compressed, fattened sustain. Sweep the blend with random stepped voltages and synced LFOs for a jittery, broken-beat vibe.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. <strong>Brutal Texture for Percussive FX</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressive Modes:</strong> Use full compression plus gain for crushed, broken drum textures reminiscent of glitch or IDM. Process otherwise simple triggers or white noise bursts to generate unique percussive one-shots with dynamically shifting character.</li>
<li><strong>Stereo Linking:</strong> Use two Autodynes in parallel for stereo or dual-bus operation. Carefully matched control positions preserve spatial polyrhythmic elements in wider mixes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6. <strong>Integrating With Modular Sequencers</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sync Compression With Sequencer Steps:</strong> Patch sequencer gates/envelopes to modulate COMP or BLEND at poly-metered rates.</li>
<li><strong>Patterned Sidechain Source:</strong> Patch a Euclidean generator, burst generator, or rotating clock divider to the sidechain for 'off-grid' rhythmic pumping not tied strictly to the percussion itself.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Bonus: Example Patch</h3>
<ol>
<li>Send percussion submix (kick, clap, percs in 7/8) → Autodyne input.</li>
<li>Set COMP just above center for noticeable pumping.</li>
<li>Set GAIN to taste (clean to hard distortion).</li>
<li>Enable highpass filter (2nd/3rd slope) to keep kicks punchy.</li>
<li>Patch a RANDOM stepped CV (sample &amp; hold) to BLEND, clocked by a divided clock for ever-changing parallel levels.</li>
<li>Patch a clave (3/4 time) into the sidechain input—now your 7/8 drums ‘duck’ with a 3/4 clave accent.</li>
</ol>

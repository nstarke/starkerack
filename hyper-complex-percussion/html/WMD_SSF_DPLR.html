<h2>Using SSF DPLR for Hyper-Complex, Densely Rhythmic Percussion</h2>
<p>The DPLR is a <strong>dual/stereo delay</strong> module packed with features that can help you sculpt densely rhythmic, intricate percussion textures, polyrhythms, and complex time signatures in a Eurorack system. Here’s how you can push it into unique, punchy, and percussive sonic territory:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Multi-Tap/Polyrhythmic Delays</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Set main <strong>DELAY AMOUNT</strong> (A) to align with a base clock or division—for example, an 8th note in your tempo.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>SPREAD (B)</strong> control to offset the B channel delay to a different rhythmic division (e.g. 3/16, prime multiples, triplets, or quintuplets). This achieves real polyrhythmic repeats from a single pulse or percussion hit.</li>
<li>Modulate <strong>DELAY A/B</strong> and <strong>SPREAD</strong> via their CV inputs with independent, sequenced or polymetric clocked modulators (e.g., clock dividers, Euclidean sequencers) for shifting, evolving delay times.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Complicated Patterns with XTALK Modes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>XTALK</strong> (cross-talk) modes to crossfeed delay lines: in higher XTALK settings, see B feeding back into A and vice versa. This blurs, smears, and interlaces rhythmic patterns between the left and right (A/B), creating unpredictable, complex echo-cascades that evolve in time.</li>
<li>Rapidly cycle XTALK modes using external gate triggers or manual button presses to change rhythmic complexity on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Filter Settings for Percussive Punch</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lighter <strong>FILTER SLOPE</strong> settings allow more high-frequency artifacts and noisy, glitchy feedback—ideal for sharp, cutting percussion echoes.</li>
<li>Heavier filtering makes the delays darker and cleaner, perfect for sculpting thumpy, subby, “body” percussion.</li>
<li>You can automate filter mode changes (by holding the mode button), or switch modes between sequences for dramatic timbral/rhythmic contrast.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Dynamic, Voltage-Controlled Feedback (REGEN)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use stepped sequencers, random voltages, or clocked LFOs to modulate <strong>REGEN</strong>. This makes the delay trails shift from very sparse to densely packed, mechanically precise bursts—great for ratcheting fills or stutters.</li>
<li>Push REGEN high for “fractal” self-oscillating repeats; pulse it low for “muted” single-echo snare-like hits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Rhythmic Stereo Movement &amp; Ping-Pong</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Exploit the stereo delay architecture: Route different percussion or “transient” voices to left/right inputs, and pan/recombine delays for moving, multi-layered grooves.</li>
<li>With differing delay times and/or XTALK fed to both outputs, even simple trigger patterns will be “exploded” into rhythmic webs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Percussive Delay Input Techniques</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use percussive “clicks,” rim-shots, or even chopped-up vocal samples as input, “smearing” them into glitchy, metallic, or re-synthesized transients by experimenting with delay times, feedback, and filter modes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. <strong>Self-Patching &amp; Feedback Networks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Try patching one output back into the input, possibly through a VCA or filter modulated by your rhythms, to create controllable burst, comb-filter, or Karplus-Strong style physical modelling effects—a source of very rich, evolving percussion.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Quick Patch Example</h4>
<ol>
<li>Send a rapid, irregular trigger pattern into a short envelope + percussive VCO and then into DPLR's input.</li>
<li><strong>Delay A:</strong> Set for a fast, clock-aligned repeat (e.g. 1/16).</li>
<li><strong>Spread B:</strong> Modulate with a slow LFO for drifting micro-time offsets.</li>
<li><strong>XTALK:</strong> Use a random gate to select mode every bar.</li>
<li><strong>Regen CV:</strong> Sequence for rhythmic bursts (ratchets, retriggers, breakbeats).</li>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> Light for glitch mode in verse, heavy for breakdown.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The DPLR’s voltage-control possibilities, cross-channel bleed, and mix of delay/filter/feedback control make it ideal for transforming any trigger, percussion voice, or audio loop into fast-evolving, deeply intricate rhythms.</p>

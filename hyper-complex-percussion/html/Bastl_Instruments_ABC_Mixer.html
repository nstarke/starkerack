<h1>Using the Bastl Instruments ABC Mixer for Hyper-Complex Percussion in Eurorack</h1>
<p>As a Eurorack modular synthesizer musician seeking densely rhythmic &amp; hyper-complex percussion, here’s how you can leverage the <strong>Bastl ABC Mixer</strong>—designed as a 6-channel audio/CV mixer—to achieve intricate polyrhythms, odd time signatures, and punchy, evolving sequences.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Core Capabilities of the ABC Mixer</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>6 inputs (A–F), each with gain control</strong> (0–1)</li>
<li><strong>2 outputs:</strong> <code>A+B+C</code> and <code>D+E+F</code> (can sum to one 6-channel mix if only using one output)</li>
<li><strong>Switchable AC/DC coupling</strong> (via solder jumpers on rear): supports both audio <em>and</em> CV signals</li>
<li><strong>Normalization jumpers</strong> for routing (A→D, B→E, C→F) — powerful for stereo splitting or dual-layer mixes</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Creative Percussive Use-Cases</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Layering Percussion for Dense Grooves</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Patch 6 unique percussion voices (e.g., kick, snare, rim, hat, click, glitch) to the 6 inputs.</li>
<li>Mix complementary voices (e.g., A: Kick, D: FM Kick; B: Snare, E: Clap) into the two output buses, allowing for thick, composite drum sounds.</li>
<li>Use the normalization jumpers to stack or split voices for stereo imaging or polyrhythmic accents.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Polyrhythmic Routing &amp; Stereo Tricks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the dual outputs (<code>A+B+C</code> as left, <code>D+E+F</code> as right) and normalization to build polyrhythms—say, a 4/4 pattern in A+B+C and a 5/4 or 7/8 pattern in D+E+F. Use a switch or step-sequencer to modulate which voices are summed to which outputs for phasey, interlocked beats.</li>
<li>With normalization, one trigger can send similar sounds to both buses, but you can mix them individually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Dynamic Muting &amp; Accent Control</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the gain knobs as manual performance tools: fade voices in for fills, punchy one-shots, or mutes to break up loops with surprising silences or sudden complexity.</li>
<li>Rapid tweaking during live jams lets you accent polyrhythmic hits by temporarily maxing a noise burst or click.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>CV Mixing for Evolving Patterns</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you patch the module as a CV mixer (modifying for DC coupling):</li>
<li>Mix several stepped/random/Euclidean CV sources (gates, envelopes, logic signals) to create wild composite triggers or modulation curves that can be sent to percussion modules’ trigger/decay/timbre inputs.</li>
<li>Use a mixture of rhythmic gates in different time signatures (e.g., input A: 3-step rhythm, B: 4-step, C: 5-step), and sum into outputs to create CV "polyrhythm" clocks or probability-based triggers for percussion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>FM/AM Audio Rhythmic Processing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Run audio-rate percussion sounds through some inputs and use the gain controls for distortion/saturation tricks.</li>
<li>Alternate between audio mixing for dense textures and fast-slew envelope/CV mixing for clicky, punchy percussion.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tips for Unique, Punchy, Complex Percussion</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use AC-coupled mode for tight, poppy transients; switch to DC coupling for CV mangling.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patch in audio signals with transients that have differing lengths and positions to create accidental swing or groove.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mute and unmute channels in sync and off-sync with the master tempo for stutter and fill effects.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use the normalization jumpers to "mirror" polyrhythmic material across both outputs for stereo motion.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Experiment with feedback loops by cross-patching outputs back through further processing before returning to an input.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If your percussion voices have individual accent ins, route a mixed, complex CV or audio gate output to those for driven groove and punch.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Further Exploration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try sending <strong>post-mixer outputs to VCAs/effects</strong> (e.g., ring mod, saturation, reverb) and use rhythmic gating to carve new grooves from the sum.  </li>
<li>Combine the ABC Mixer with clock dividers, logic, Euclidean sequencers, and probability generators for ever-morphing patterns.</li>
<li>Use feedback: take one of the outputs, process (distort, wavefold, filter), and patch back in to an input—carefully—for evolving percussive soundscapes.</li>
</ul>

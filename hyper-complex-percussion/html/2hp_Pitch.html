<h2>Using 2hp Pitch for Complex, Densely Rhythmic Percussion in Eurorack</h2>
<p><strong>2hp Pitch</strong> is a time domain pitch shifter with integrated "wow &amp; flutter" (W&amp;F) effects. Though primarily used for transposing signals and tape-like effects, you can leverage its feature set to create unique, punchy, and percussive textures—ideal for modern, micro-edited, hyper-complex rhythm music.</p>
<p>Below are strategies to make the most out of this 2hp effect in pursuit of intricate percussive patterns and polyrhythmic madness.</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. <strong>Percussion Layer Enhancement via Pitch Shifting</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feed drum or percussion voices</strong> (such as kicks, hi-hats, glitches, foley, or physical modeling percs) into the <code>Audio Input</code>. </li>
<li>Use the <strong>Pitch Knob and 1V/OCT Input</strong> to transpose or modulate the sound. Rapid, clock-synced, or trigger-driven pitch modulation creates stuttering, ratcheting, or evolving timbral changes.<ul>
<li><strong>Complex rhythms:</strong> Use a polyrhythmic CV sequencer to drive 1V/OCT, 'retuning' each percussion hit differently in various time divisions.</li>
<li><strong>Modulate pitch with rhythmic LFOs:</strong> Use multiplyable clocked LFOs, fed into the 1V/OCT input, at different polyrhythmic intervals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>2. <strong>Pseudo-Tape Effects for Percussion Manipulation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>W&amp;F Knob</strong> or input random CV via <code>W&amp;F CV Input</code> to add random fluctuation/tape instability.<ul>
<li><strong>Per-cussion punch:</strong> Hard, quick modulation at rhythmically relevant moments (e.g. via fast, stepped random or S&amp;H synced to triggers) can make each percussion hit slightly different.</li>
<li><strong>Swing/syncopation:</strong> Use <code>W&amp;F</code> with clocked but offset CV sources to introduce subtle off-grid timing and pitch artifacts, especially interesting with hi-hats, shakers, or FM percussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>3. <strong>Mix/Shaping per Hit for Dynamic Rhythm Complexity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Mix CV Input</strong> allows dynamic blending between dry (original) and wet (pitch-shifted) signals. Patch a rhythmic CV source (clock divider, burst generator, trigger sequencer) into Mix CV.<ul>
<li><strong>Patterned accents:</strong> Use Euclidean or polyrhythmic gates as Mix CV for intricate patterns of “dry” and “wet” sounds throughout a bar, almost like automated send FX.</li>
<li><strong>Morphing timbres:</strong> Automate Mix knob in time with your complex rhythm structures to add 'ghost' or shadow hits, echoes, or slurred effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>4. <strong>Advanced Patch Ideas</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual Pitch:</strong><ul>
<li>If you have two percussion voices (or split a mono signal), run one through Pitch at +7 semitones, the other at -5, and recombine. Layer patterns for stacked, "digital polyrhythm" percussion lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Feedback/Buffer Hacks:</strong><ul>
<li>Feed the output back to the input via a CV-controllable VCA for glitchy, unpredictable patterns. Wet signal detuning + feedback + W&amp;F = complex, ever-changing digital percussion clouds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Combo with Your Sequencer:</strong><ul>
<li>Use a trigger sequencer (modular or external) to generate uneven divisions (e.g. 5/8, 7/16), and use these as CV sources for Pitch and Mix for polymetric movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>5. <strong>Make it Hyper-Modern and Punchy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sharp, Sync’d CV:</strong><ul>
<li>Use stepped, quantized random CV (like a Turing Machine or Sample &amp; Hold) into the 1V/OCT or W&amp;F input, clocked by your master rhythm or at divisions thereof.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accentuation:</strong><ul>
<li>Accent certain hits by automating pitch jump (e.g., suddenly +2 octaves on every 9th step), or quick, harsh W&amp;F burst on off-beats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chop and Glitch:</strong><ul>
<li>Send granulated, micro-edited patterns into Pitch, modulate heavily, and crossfade fast between dry and wet for “granular drum machine” effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>6. <strong>In the Larger Patch</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feed</strong> micro-edited loops, glitch buffers, or sample-sliced drum kits (e.g. from sampler modules) into Pitch.</li>
<li><strong>Combine</strong> with sequential switches, logic, or complex gate processors to drive CV inputs in ever-shifting, polyrhythmic architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Record</strong> the output into a buffer/looper (e.g., 2hp Loop) for evolving, fractal-sounding percussion beds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key Principles:</strong>
- Treat 2hp Pitch as a rhythmic tool, not just a pitch shifter.
- Modulate everything with rhythmically interesting CV.
- Combine with clocked, random, or step-sequenced sources for non-repetitive drumming.
- Layer processed (wet) and unprocessed (dry) percussion for syncopation and drive.</p>

<h1>Using the 7Path - Ethernet Patch Cable Bridge for Hyper Complex Rhythmic Eurorack Patching</h1>
<p>The <strong>7Path</strong> module is not a sound generator or an effect; it is a clever utility that allows you to route up to 7 signals between two physical locations in your modular setup using a single Ethernet cable. This makes it a powerful organizational and creative tool for advanced rhythmic and polyrhythmic patching. Here’s how you can leverage this in the pursuit of dense, complex percussive sequences:</p>
<hr />
<h2>Creative Uses for Hyper Complex Rhythms &amp; Percussion</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Patch Dense Trigger/Clock Networks Between Cases</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have multiple cases (or multiple hands-on areas within a huge case), each with sequencers, clock dividers, logic modules, and drum voices.</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> Route triggers, clocks, resets, and CVs for rhythms through the 7Path. For instance:<ul>
<li>Send several different clock divisions and polyrhythmic triggers from one case/sequencer to another without crossing your entire rig with long patch cables.</li>
<li>Sequence ‘A’ in case one can trigger percussion voices in case two, while CV modulation floats the other direction, enabling very non-local and complex interaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Facilitate Polyrhythmic Pattern Generation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Want to intertwine different time signatures or create evolving, complex patterns?</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> Use clock generators or sequencers producing 5/4, 7/8, etc., and send these as individual triggers via the 7Path to distant modules.<ul>
<li>Route a Euclidean sequencer’s polyrhythmic outputs to multiple drum voices far away in your setup, letting their complexity cross-pollinate other timing systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Distributed Logic for Advanced Rhythms</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Using logic modules (AND, OR, XOR) to combine rhythmic gates and triggers.</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> Patch logic outputs or inputs from logic modules on one side of your system through 7Path to interact with sequencers, dividers, and drum modules elsewhere. This is especially good for:<ul>
<li>Muting/unmuting layers by remote logic gates.</li>
<li>Combining triggers from spatially separated sources for surprise polyphonic percussion hits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Complex FX Routing for Percussion</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Manipulate percussive voices or CV with unique and punchy effects.</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> Use 7Path to route dynamic envelopes, LFOs, or stepped random CV from complex modulation generators in one case to VCFs, VCAs, or distortions processing drum voices in another. Introduce cross-case sidechaining or ducking.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Instant Re-Patching, Modular ‘Scene’ Changes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Need rapid re-routing without the cable mess, improvising live or in the studio.</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> Keep the 7Path “bus” as your main bridge—quickly shift what signals travel through its 7 lines to completely reshape groove and density on the fly, swapping trigger routings for fresh percussive interplay.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Workflow Example:</h2>
<p><strong>Case A:</strong> Dedicated to complex rhythm gen (Pam’s New Workout, Ornament &amp; Crime in Sequencer mode, Logic Modules).</p>
<p><strong>Case B:</strong> Drum voices, percussive synths, and FX based percussion (filters, wavefolders, VCAs with short envelopes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 7Path to send:<ol>
<li>Two polyrhythmic triggers (say, a 5-step and a 7-step Euclidean).</li>
<li>Clock divider’s triplet output.</li>
<li>Random stepped CV for pitch/articulation.</li>
<li>Envelope from Case A for accent or punch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Receive in Case B:<ul>
<li>Route all 7 inputs to different percussion voices, or mix and match using stackables and logic to hybridize dense patterns.</li>
<li>Feedback: Send a percussive accent or effect send trigger <em>back</em> through a different 7Path channel, creating a feedback control loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Why This Is Uniquely Powerful</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Signal Restriction:</strong> Any type of eurorack signal can be routed (triggers, gates, audio, CV).</li>
<li><strong>1-to-1 Mapping:</strong> Patch input #4 on one, get the output on #4 at the other—super predictable for fast, performative workflow.</li>
<li><strong>No Power Required:</strong> Passive, small, and doesn’t eat up headers or case power budget.</li>
<li><strong>Organizational Tool:</strong> Reduces cable clutter, especially with dense rhythmic patching, making setup and teardown less stressful and highly modular in the literal sense.</li>
</ul>

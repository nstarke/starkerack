<h2>Using the 2hp EG for Dense, Hyper-Complex Percussion</h2>
<p>The 2hp EG is an ultra-compact, full-featured two-stage envelope generator. In your pursuit of hyper-complex, densely rhythmic percussion with polyrhythms, odd time signatures, and wild textures, this module can become a central utility—especially if you’re working within tight HP constraints or want multiple envelope generators in your system.</p>
<h3>Core Strengths for Complex Percussion</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra-Fast to Ultra-Slow Envelopes:</strong> Ranges from punchy 3ms attacks/decays up to sprawling 11 minute swells per stage.</li>
<li><strong>Linear/Exponential Curve Options:</strong> Dial in snappy "percussive" or smooth "natural" contours on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Built-In CV Attenuator:</strong> Modulate your envelope amplitude for dynamic grooves or evolving accent patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated CV Over Attack/Decay:</strong> Voltage control means you can sequence or modulate your rhythmic shapes for intricate patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Tiny Form Factor:</strong> Stuff more envelope action into your case for maximal layering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategies for Generating Complex, Rhythmic Percussion</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Multiple EGs for Polyrhythms</strong></h4>
<p>To exploit advanced rhythms, use several EGs—each trigged by a different clock division, pattern generator, or probabilistic gate. Sum their outputs to a VCA or combine them to modulate different drum/percussion voices, with each generator shaping a distinct percussive event at a distinct rhythmic subdivision.</p>
<p><strong>Example Patch:</strong>
- EG1: Trigged by a 5-step clock; CV modulating decay with a random stepped generator for irregular swing.
- EG2: Trigged by a 7-step clock; CV modulating attack from a Euclidean pattern.
- Both envelopes go to separate VCAs/drum modules, or are mixed to create staggered, polyphonic percussion bursts.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Envelope Modulation for Evolving Grooves</strong></h4>
<p>The CV inputs for attack and decay are critical for programmed complexity. Use LFOs, stepped random voltages, sequencers, or envelope followers to continually change the envelope shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Random stepped CV to Decay: Each trig results in subtly (or drastically) different envelope lengths for organic percussion.</li>
<li>Euclidean gate/patterns to Attack CV: Shifting how "punched" or "soft" each hit is for expressive grooves.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. <strong>Linear vs Exponential</strong></h4>
<p>Switch between linear and exponential responses for each rhythm or even automate the toggle with a “hand-on” approach during performance. Linear provides harder, more mechanical percussion; exponential gives you snappier, more natural drum contours.</p>
<h4>4. <strong>Attenuation for Accent Patterns</strong></h4>
<p>The AMP knob can be used to program accents: Manually or via CV, reduce amplitude on unaccented steps to create ghost notes, or amplify certain pulses to make accented hits pop.</p>
<h4>5. <strong>Envelope as Audio Source</strong></h4>
<p>For even more unique results: Use the envelope OUT as an audio-rate source for "clicks," “ticks,” or layered percussive noise, especially with fast decay settings. The module slams out fast voltage spikes that can be filtered or waveshaped for glitchy percussion.</p>

<h3>Pro Tips for Uniqueness, Punch, and Percussiveness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use very fast attack/decay times with exponential response for “transient designer” style punch.</li>
<li>Stack several EGs for layered transients, each modulated separately to avoid robotic repetition.</li>
<li>Route EG outs to filter CVs (especially ultra-snappy attacks) to create "snap" or "pluck" percussion, or to FM drum VCOs for clicky, metallic timbres.</li>
<li>Combine envelopes of different lengths (polyrhythmic cycling) for non-repeating grooves.</li>
<li>Change attack/decay times on the fly with sequencer lanes assigned to CV ins for morphing between percussive feels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Stereoweaver for Densely Rhythmic, Hyper-Complex Percussion</h2>
<h3>1. Module Context &amp; Approach</h3>
<p>The <strong>Kaona Stereoweaver</strong> is an advanced stereo effects module, not a sound source/voice, so it processes your percussion signals rather than generating them. It excels at spatial manipulation—depth, motion, phase shifting, Haas effect (micro-delays), and dynamic width—using psychoacoustic principles.</p>
<p>To enhance <strong>complex, polyrhythmic, or experimental percussion</strong>, patch your <strong>mono drum/percussion mix, single drum voice, or highly complex trigger-based percussion</strong> into Stereoweaver’s input. Its outputs immediately provide a transformed stereo image.</p>
<h3>2. Techniques for Dense, Punchy Rhythms</h3>
<h4>A. <strong>CV Animation for Sequence Stereoscopy/Texture</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch rhythmic/clocked/random/Euclidean CV sequencers or internal triggers to Stereoweaver’s CV inputs</strong>:  </li>
<li><strong>Depth CV</strong>: Use triggers or stepped random signals to accentuate or hollow out the perceived space on every beat or subdivision.</li>
<li><strong>Width CV &amp; Move</strong>: Modulate width using Euclidean polyrhythms; have each drum “jump” around the stereo field based on complex trigger/gate patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Phase CV</strong>: Modulate on odd-time pulses (5/8, 7/16) so phase relationships are never static; this can create evolving, lively, and slightly "uneasy" spatial textures perfect for intricate percussion.</li>
<li><strong>Motion CV</strong>: Animate Leslie/rotary effects with LFOs synced to non-standard clock divisions (e.g., 3 against 4), so swirling spatiality is itself polyrhythmic.</li>
</ul>
<h4>B. <strong>Articulation and Percussive Punch</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drive the input HARD</strong> for controlled saturation:<br />
  Use distortion intentionally on each transient-heavy percussion hit. Adjust input gain until the LED blinks in time—let it overload on strong downbeats for added punch, or modulate gain control voltage with trigger envelopes for hit-by-hit “coloration.”</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the Haas and Micro-Delay</strong>:<br />
  Push the Haas setting hard, or modulate with a stepped random or variable clock so different hits or pulses have different stereo delays—this creates a tangled, urgent stereo feel, emphasizing intricate rhythms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>C. <strong>Chaos and Unpredictability</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animate ‘Move’ at audio rates or with highly irregular gates</strong>:<br />
  Patch burst generators, logic patterns, or heavily clock-divided clocks to the Motion/Width CVs. In “Move” mode, this swaps L/R unexpectedly, making your patterns feel “glitchy” and kinetic.</li>
<li><strong>Max out Phase + Depth for Micro-Chorus/Phasing</strong>:<br />
  At extreme settings, your percussive hits can become subtly flanged or phase-shifted. Accent minor notes with these modulations for unique timbral ripples.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Patch Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakcore/Jungle</strong>: Use a trigger sequencer sending triggers on both regular and offgrid pulses to the Width and Phase CVs. Stereo image will jump according to rhythmic density.</li>
<li><strong>Polyrhythmic Techno</strong>: Assign clocks from different meters (e.g., 5-step and 7-step) to modulate Haas/Width. Layered drums “dance” around the cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Electroacoustic</strong>: Pair with acoustic percussion sounds or foley, let complex envelopes modulate Depth and Phase in conjunction with touch/pressure or sensor-based CV, for gestural spatiality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. General Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mult different CV sources</strong> (clock divisions, envelope followers, random gates) to several parameters for hyper-complicated, interconnected rhythmic spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Stereo Balance</strong>: Use the independent L/R outputs to further process with stereo compressors or spatializers—Stereoweaver can feed parallel effects chains for even more depth.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Feedback</strong>: The on-panel LEDs help you “see” when movement or widening is happening, making precise tuning for rhythmic mapping easy.</li>
</ul>

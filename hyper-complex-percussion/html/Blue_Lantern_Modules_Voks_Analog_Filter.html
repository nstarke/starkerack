<h2>Using the BLM Voks Analog Filter for Dense, Hyper-Complex Percussion (Eurorack)</h2>
<h3>About the Module</h3>
<p>The <strong>BLM Voks Analog Filter</strong> is a Polivoks-style analog VCF updated with several "hacks" for character and performance.<br />
<strong>Key Features:</strong>
- 12dB Low Pass &amp; 6dB Band Pass (each with its own output)
- Normal and "Unstable Brite" modes (switchable)
- Internal Limiter Diode (switchable)
- Multiple CV and audio inputs (including direct, attenuated, and bipolar FM)
- 6hp, 13mA current</p>
<p>This is a filter, not a complete voice, but can absolutely be used for percussion shaping and creative processing.</p>

<h2>Patch Techniques for Complex Percussion</h2>
<h3>1. Percussive Voice Shaping (Filter as Main Sound Source)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch a fast, plucky envelope</strong> (ADSR with immediate attack and short decay) to both the <em>audio input</em> and either CV or FM inputs. Use the Voks' resonance and brite/unstable mode to make the filter “ping” and self-oscillate, giving you percussive pops or “kick” sounds.</li>
<li>Mult envelopes to clock-divided rhythms to create <em>polyrhythmic</em> bursts through the filter.</li>
<li>Use comparators or logic modules to mix fast, odd-length triggers/gates that control the envelope, resulting in complex—sometimes generative—percussive patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Rhythmic Processing &amp; Mutating Loops</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feed rich audio (e.g., noise, digital drum samples, metallic tones) into the filter’s <em>direct input</em>.</li>
<li>Patch rhythmic envelopes, gates, and complex LFOs (e.g., from Pamela’s New Workout, Zadar, etc.) to the <em>CV and FM inputs</em>.</li>
<li>Crossfade between LPF and BPF outputs dynamically using a VC mixer or switch, modulated by yet <em>another</em> polyrhythmic source.</li>
<li>Flick between Normal and Unstable Brite mode on beats or “off-beats” via a gate or manual performance, taking advantage of its unique, acidic filter distortion for variety and punch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Multi-Layer Polyrhythms (Filter as Modulation Target)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drive the filter cutoff with separate CVs that are clocked to different divisions/multiples of your master tempo. For example: a 5-step LFO for cutoff and a 7-step sequenced envelope for FM.</li>
<li>Combine filtered percussion with highly clocked, rhythmically skewed modulations to create movement and groove—making your drum sequences feel "played" and not looped.</li>
<li>Send the same percussion sound to <em>both</em> LPF and BPF, but modulate depths and timbres differently for superimposed cross-rhythms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Limiter &amp; Distortion for Percussive Cut</h3>
<ul>
<li>The internal limiter (switchable by front-panel) can shape transients, making your drums more <em>punchy</em> and controlled.</li>
<li>Toggle the limiter <em>on and off</em> in-sync with specific beats or sub-patterns, emphasizing syncopation and attack in unexpected moments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Wild FM Percussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Route clicky triggers or audio-rate pulses to the <em>bipolar FM input</em>, making the filter “chatter” or bark at audio rate or with unpredictable chaos, especially in Unstable Brite Mode.</li>
<li>You can further accentuate this by using sequenced voltages or S&amp;H, clocked oddly against the drum grid.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Pro Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audio Input Overloading:</strong> Push hot signals or stack multiple sounds; the characterful clipping of the filter will help your percussion cut through, especially in dense mixes.</li>
<li><strong>External Clock Logic:</strong> Use clock dividers/multipliers and logic modules (AND, XOR, etc.) to generate gate patterns that trigger modulations to the filter in non-obvious polyrhythms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The BLM Voks Analog Filter is not just for classic synth filtering—it’s an aggressive, personality-driven sound-shaper. With strategic CV and rhythmic modulation, it becomes a powerful tool for hyper-complex, punchy, and uniquely percussive patches in your Eurorack system.</p>

<h1>How to Use Plaits for Densely Rhythmic &amp; Hyper Complex Percussion</h1>
<p>Mutable Instruments Plaits is a digital macro-oscillator that is capable of being a <em>full percussive voice generator</em> in addition to more traditional melodic and textural duties. The following strategies, drawing from the manual, will guide you in building music with dense, complex, and polyrhythmic percussion.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Choose the Right Models</strong></h2>
<p>Plaits includes several synthesis models well-suited for percussion/complex rhythms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bank 2:</strong> Noisy and Percussive Models.</li>
<li><em>Drum synthesis models (kick, snare, hihat/cymbals)</em>.</li>
<li><em>Physical modeling (mini-Rings: string, bar, tube)</em>.</li>
<li><em>Granular noise, dust, filtered noise</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For percussion, cycle to these models using the model selection buttons. Experiment with the AUX out for alternate timbres.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Triggering &amp; Polyrhythm Creation</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRIG Input:</strong><br />
  Patch distinctly clocked, irregular, or polyrhythmic trigger patterns into the TRIG input.  </li>
<li>Use multiple trigger generators—e.g. Euclidean sequencers, clock dividers/multipliers, or step sequencers running at odd divisions (3, 5, 7, etc).</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-patch clocks from sequencers with different time signatures for polyrhythms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LEVEL Input:</strong><br />
  Patch envelope generators, sequencer CVs, or accent patterns to LEVEL. This will simultaneously control amplitude and timbral brightness for each hit—introducing variation and punch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TRIG plus unpatched CV Inputs:</strong><br />
  If TIMBRE, MORPH, or FM CVs are left unpatched, the respective attenuverters can set how much <em>internal envelope modulation</em> affects those parameters. Crank these for hyper-punchy, dynamic timbre with each hit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Complex Parameter Modulation</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>External CV Modulation:</strong>  </li>
<li>Use fast, stepped, or even random/noise CV sources to modulate TIMBRE, MORPH, FM, and HARMONICS.  </li>
<li>
<p>Sequencers running at polyrhythmic divisions can be routed separately to each modulation input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Selection CV Input:</strong><br />
  Sequence (or randomly modulate) the Model Select CV input in time with (or offset from) your main triggers—Plaits will change drum types/pitched/noise elements on the fly. When patched to trigger, the model only changes on trigger, allowing per-step timbre switching.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>Accentuation &amp; Groove</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accent/Groove:</strong><br />
  Send an additional trigger/gate or CV to LEVEL on specific rhythmic steps (e.g. every 4th or 7th). This can function as an “accent” and impact both loudness and tonal brightness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decay &amp; Envelope Settings:</strong><br />
  Hold the first button (A) and use:</p>
</li>
<li><em>MORPH knob:</em> Set the LPG/envelope decay appropriately—short for sharp, punchy hits, longer for reverb-y, overlapping textures.</li>
<li><em>TIMBRE knob:</em> Adjust LPG from VCA (sharpest) to VCFA (more rounded/transient).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. <strong>Unusual Voicings and Textures</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use additive, wavetable, and granular models—tuned to percussive ranges—by keeping frequency low and modulating wave/harmonic spread for metallic, glitch, or Eraserhead-style percussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank the module into speech/voice synthesis for chopped, stuttered, or robotic rhythmic elements, modulating CLOCK/trigger to scan phonemes in rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use “modal resonator” and “inharmonic string” models for organic, quasi-acoustic percussive effects by sending very rapid or irregular triggers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. <strong>Advanced: Firmware &amp; Calibration</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configure a tight <em>frequency knob range</em> (hold second button; turn HARMONICS) to avoid accidental pitch sweeping that could mess up percussive articulation mid-performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If using as a multi-sound drum voice (model switching via CV/trigger), calibrate Plaits so that 1V/oct CV from a well-calibrated sequencer precisely switches models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Creative Tips:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layer with Other Modules</strong>: Use AUX and OUT for stereo/dual timbral layering, or process separately with differing effects for extra complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Silence as Rhythm</strong>: Some models will output silence at certain parameter extremes—sequence these momentary mutes for stutter/shuffle effects.</li>
<li><strong>Randomize</strong>: Use sample &amp; hold, stepped random, or Turing machine sources into model or timbre to maintain unpredictability in your percussion.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback FM</strong>: Use FM modulation from another Plaits or digital source clocked at a related, but offset, rhythm for cross-modulated percussion.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Quick Patch Example</strong></h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">1. Set model to bank 2 “drum” type.
2. Patch three different Euclidean sequencer outputs (e.g., 5-step, 7-step, 11-step) into TRIG, MODEL select CV, and TIMBRE CV.
3. Set LEVEL to a fast S&amp;H sequence.
4. Modulate DECAY and LPG response for desired percussiveness.
5. Use OUT and AUX for two separate percussion voices in your mix.

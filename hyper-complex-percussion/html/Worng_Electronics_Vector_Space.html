<h1>Using the WORNG Electronics Vector Space for Densely Rhythmic, Hyper-Complex Percussion in Eurorack</h1>
<p>As a modular synthesist, the WORNG Vector Space is a uniquely powerful tool for sculpting polyrhythmic, polymetric, and deeply intertwined percussion and rhythm sequences. Here’s how you can unlock its dense rhythmic potential:</p>
<h2>1. <strong>Polyrhythmic &amp; Complex Gate/Trigger Generation</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Patch Concept: “Rhythm Splintering”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> Three clock, trigger, or gate sources each running at different rates or time divisions (e.g. 5, 7, 9).</li>
<li><strong>How to patch:</strong></li>
<li>Patch each clock/gate stream into the i, j, and k inputs of the Vector Space. Use a mix of clock generators, sequencer triggers, or LFOs with pulse outputs.</li>
<li>Experiment with the input voltage switches (++/+-) to transform the polarity and offset of the incoming signals.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Cube Outputs</strong> as complex gate/trigger outputs: They will present logical AND/OR/XOR/NOT-style combinations of the inputs, but with phase relationships and analog blending—so not simply digital logic, but richer, more nuanced gate blends.</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Plane Outputs</strong> offer even more intricate, rectified and summed combinations—perfect for non-standard triggers and “ghost” hits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> Patch these outputs into drum modules, percussive sound VCAs, end-of-chain effect gates, or envelope triggers. You’ll quickly create “impossible” time signatures and evolving polyrhythms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>CV Modulation for Rhythmic Complexity</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Patch Concept: “Fractal Envelopes”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch multiple asynchronous LFOs, random gates, or looping envelopes into the Vector Space inputs.</li>
<li>Send several outputs (particularly Planes and Spheres) to modulate parameters like decay, pitch, filter cutoff, or effect amounts in your percussion voices.</li>
<li>This layering multiplies micro-variation, adding “human” shuffle, groove, and constantly morphing accents to your percussion.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Self-Patching Feedback Rhythms</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Patch Concept: “Recursive Drumming”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Patch selected outputs from the Vector Space back into clock divider/multiplier CV inputs, or to modulate LFO rates that re-enter the Vector Space.</li>
<li>This creates feedback/chaos loops, where the timing structures feed on themselves for evolving, unpredictable rhythms.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>CV-Controlled Probability &amp; Swing</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> output (with its summed, rectified, and net-distance approach) to control probability/skipping modules or VCAs.</li>
<li>The complex, ambiguous blend of your three inputs will create “weighted” gates and CVs, great for probability-based rhythm or “random accents.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. <strong>Voice/Effector Use: Making Percussion Unique, Punchy, Percussive</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>If</em> you’re running audio through Vector Space, try feeding short, percussive tones (e.g. sine pings, metallic FM pulses, glitches) into i/j/k. The output blends will create metallic clangs, distorted syncs, AM/FM hybrids, and mysterious timbres otherwise hard to achieve.</li>
<li>The <strong>Cube</strong> outputs yield phase-varied combinations (think of syncopated stack-ups), while the <strong>Plane</strong> outputs add upper harmonics for aggressive, punchy attack. </li>
<li>Use the modulation outputs (especially those with LEDs flickering rapidly) to amplitude or filter-modulate your percussion audio for extra punch and complexity.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to audition via an envelope follower and external VCA to emphasize dynamic punchiness.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. <strong>Concrete Example Patch for Ultrarhythmic Percussion</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inputs:</strong></li>
<li>i: Euclidean gate sequence (e.g. 5 steps in 16).</li>
<li>j: LFO square, free-running at non-multiplicative rate.</li>
<li>
<p>k: Chaotic stepped random voltage (clocked independently).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cube Outs:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patch four Cube outputs to trigger kick, snare, hat, and percussion sound sources. Each will rumble with offset timing and shifting polyrhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plane Outs:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Plane outs as accent triggers or to modulate decay/release amounts on your drums, creating shifting ghost notes and fills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sphere/UnSphere:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Use these as modulation for probability/swing (via a CV-able Bernoulli gate or swing generator), so that swing and randomness evolves with the overall “vector” motion in rhythm space.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Tips for Extreme Percussion with Vector Space</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use offset switches as live manipulation tools while recording or performing.</li>
<li>Patch some outputs to amplitude or timbre CV of percussion voices for wild, organic, living digital percussion.</li>
<li>Repatch frequently—small inputs changes can lead to major rhythmic breakthroughs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The WORNG Vector Space is not simply a utility but a central nervous system for generative and polyrhythmic percussion—the more unstable, offset, and cross-modulated your inputs, the more singular your rhythmic output!</p>

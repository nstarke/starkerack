<h1>Using Afterneath for Densely Rhythmic, Hyper-Complex Percussion in Modular Synthesis</h1>
<p>The <strong>Afterneath</strong> by EarthQuaker Devices, while designed as a reverb/effect, is an extraordinarily malleable module for rhythmic and percussive complexity—especially if you lean into its voltage-controllable, delay-line-based structure. Here’s how you can weaponize its parameters for generative drumming, complex polyrhythms, and outré percussion.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Understanding Your Tool: Afterneath as a Rhythmic Engine</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not just a reverb:</strong> The Afterneath is a cluster of short delay lines, not a standard reverb. This gives it a “smearing,” pingy or stuttering potential.</li>
<li><strong>CV Control:</strong> The Drag, Mode, Diffuse, and Length parameters are all voltage controllable with dedicated inverting attenuators—perfect for dynamic manipulation via external rhythmic, trigger, or sequencer sources.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Oscillation:</strong> At high Length and Reflect, it can self-oscillate—opening up pseudo-voice/oscillator duties driven by rhythmically-triggered CV.</li>
<li><strong>External Feedback Loop:</strong> Via Reflect Send/Return—process the feedback path with rhythmic VCA chopping, filtering, or even clocked effects for synced complexity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Strategies for Hyper-Complex &amp; Percussive Rhythmic Exploration</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Rhythmic CV Modulation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag CV Input:</strong> The Drag control is where dense rhythm action happens. Patch fast/complex envelopes, random clocks, trigger sequencers, burst generators, or sharply rhythmic LFOs here—each change in Drag shifts the ‘delay tap’ times, creating pronounced stuttering, time-warped, and even pitched effects. Use a clock divider/multiplier for polyrhythms!</li>
<li><strong>Mode Selection:</strong> In quantized modes (4-9), Drag tracks 1V/oct for pitch-rhythmic relationships. In non-quantized modes, it's much more freeform—try both!</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Percussion Sound Design</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Oscillation Percussion:</strong> Crank Reflect and Length &gt; 12 o'clock. Trigger the Drag CV input with fast envelopes, gates, or random step CV sources to “strike” the reverb buffer, generating tonal/atonal pings perfect for IDM, glitch, or experimental rhythms.</li>
<li><strong>“Chopped” FX:</strong> Use the Reflect Send to reroute the feedback path through a VCA sequenced with sharp rhythmic gates/triggers—this creates gated, isntrumental, or sliced-percussion effects.</li>
<li><strong>Input Drive:</strong> Input control at modular level ensures incoming drum sources are punchy and don’t get washed out. Overdrive the input for transient snap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Complex Patterns/Polyrhythms</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Drag CVs:</strong> Patch two or more LFOs, each at an odd/even multiple (e.g., 5/7 against 4/8), through a CV mixer or sequential switch into Drag. This modulates delay density polyrhythmically.</li>
<li><strong>Step Sequencer Per Mod Destination:</strong> Send different sequenced voltages to Drag, Diffuse, Mode, and Length for evolving textures. Use odd-length sequences (e.g., 7-step, 13-step) for maximum temporal complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Burst Gates:</strong> Use burst generators or clock randomizers patched through logic modules for unpredictable, organic rhythm bursts—these will make the reverb “skip” unpredictably.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Creating Perceptual “Punch” and Clarity</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short Length, High Dampen, High Input:</strong> For crisp, transient-rich percussive effects, keep Length and Diffuse low, Dampen higher (for brightness), and drive the input.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect Feedback Abuse:</strong> Inject noise, envelopes, or short triggers into Reflect Return to “re-strike” the input with feedback-tuned transient artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>CV Attenuator Tuning:</strong> The inverting attenuators allow for both normal and “reversed” CV directions—use this to invert the correlation between your CV and the resulting sound for more variety.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Stereo and Spatial Play</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pseudo-Stereo Outputs:</strong> Mult output and Reflect Send to two mixer channels or main outputs. Use external processing on one branch (distortion, filtering) for a moving image, as the manual suggests—this makes complex patterns feel wider and less cluttered.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Additional Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with sequencers that offer probability or randomization for real “beyond-human” rhythm.</li>
<li>Use Mode CV (with a stepped/trigger source) to rhythmically jump between quantization scales per bar/beat.</li>
<li>Use chained VCAs or matrix mixers before the CV inputs to “draw” rhymic scenes or interpolate between beats with fine control.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Inspirational Patch Example</h2>
<pre><code>Kick Drum → Afterneath Input
Trigger Sequencer (odd-length steps) → Drag CV (through attenuator)
Euclidean Burst Generator → Reflect Return (audio)
Maths/Envelope → Diffuse CV (inverted on alternate bars)
Reflect Send → Distortion → Right output
Dry Output → Left output
</code></pre>
<p>This patch will create polyrhythmic, stuttering, clap-like bursts with swirling, glitched reflections—making even a basic drum pattern hyper-complex and evolving.</p>

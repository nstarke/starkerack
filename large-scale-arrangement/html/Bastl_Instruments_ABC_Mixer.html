<h1>Using the Bastl Instruments ABC 6-Channel Mixer to Build Full Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://bastl-instruments.com/products/abc">Bastl Instruments ABC</a> is a six-channel mixer specifically aimed at combining audio or CV signals in a compact 5HP format. It provides two summed outputs — A+B+C and D+E+F — and includes flexible normalization and solder jumpers for AC (audio) or DC (CV) mixing.</p>
<h2>Key Features for Song Creation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>6 Audio or CV Inputs</strong> (A, B, C, D, E, F)</li>
<li><strong>Two Summing Outs:</strong> A+B+C &amp; D+E+F; can become a single 6-channel mix</li>
<li><strong>Normalization Jumpers:</strong> Useful for stereo mixing or layer splitting</li>
<li><strong>Individual Gain for Each Channel</strong></li>
<li><strong>DC Coupling Option:</strong> Lets you mix CVs for parameter control/morphing</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Creative Uses for Full-Length Song Construction</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Dynamic Submixing of Groups (Song Parts)</strong></h3>
<p>Use the module as two 3-channel mixers for grouping instrumental layers:
- <strong>A+B+C:</strong> Drums/perc, main synth, bass
- <strong>D+E+F:</strong> Pads, leads, FX</p>
<p><strong>Live Song Structure Tactic:</strong><br />
Patch all voices into the mixer, then perform transitions/muting by turning channel gains up &amp; down or by patching in/out the group outputs. This helps create intros, breakdowns, drops, and outros by fading groups in/out.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. <strong>Manual Performance/Automation</strong></h3>
<p>Assign mixer channels to various song sections:
- Channel A: Verse synth
- Channel B: Chorus synth
- Channel C: Bridge FX</p>
<p><strong>Performance tip:</strong><br />
Use active muting (by turning the gain knob fully down) to bring parts in/out by hand—even if your sequencers are firing all patterns at once. This is a tactile way to “arrange” live.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. <strong>Morphing Between Song Sections Using CV Mixing</strong></h3>
<p>By modifying the mixer for DC coupling (solder jumpers), you can mix LFO/envelope CVs that control other modules (VCAs, filters, effect sends).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Channel A: Envelope for verse intensity
- Channel B: LFO for transitions
- Channel C: Envelope for breakdown FX</p>
<p>Sum these, then send the output to modulate effects or VCAs—the evolving CV shapes can “morph” your song structures automatically.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. <strong>Stereo/Fake-Stereo Arrangements</strong></h3>
<p>Use the normalization jumpers on the back to pair:
- A→D, B→E, C→F<br />
Send different signals to the L/R outputs; pan drums left, synths right, FX center—giving your songs a sense of movement over time.</p>
<hr />
<h3>5. <strong>Scene Switching with Shared Outputs</strong></h3>
<p>When nothing is plugged into A+B+C, this mix is summed into D+E+F.<br />
- <strong>Patch D+E+F to a master VCA or FX send:</strong> This lets you crossfade between full arrangement (all 6 channels) and subgroup (3 channels only), building in/outro sections.</p>
<hr />
<h3>6. <strong>Performance Combinations</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Patch Scenario:</strong>
- A: Kick
- B: Snare
- C: Hats
- D: Bass
- E: Chord synth
- F: Lead melody</p>
<p><strong>Full Mix to Output:</strong> All channels
<strong>Drop to Drums + Bass Only:</strong> Mute E, F (turn down)
<strong>Breakdown:</strong> Kill A, B, D (only hats + chords remain)
<strong>Drop:</strong> Bring all channels back
<strong>Outro:</strong> Fade down each group</p>
<hr />
<h3>Practical Workflow for Full-Length Songs</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-Patch Sections:</strong> Pre-patch all instruments; decide what channels group into which song section.</li>
<li><strong>Manual or Automated Muting:</strong> Use mixer channel knobs to “write” your arrangement in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Send Mixes to Effects or Sidechains:</strong> For further variation, patch outputs to FX modules or sidechains for builds and drops.</li>
<li><strong>Layer with Additional Automation:</strong> Use CV mixing to organically morph sections (volume, modulation, FX sends).</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The ABC mixer is not just utility—it’s a hands-on performance and arrangement tool that lets you shape your eurorack jams into coherent, evolving full-length songs. Combine channel assignments, mutes, fades, CV mixing, and stereo tricks to perform or multitrack entire arrangements with structural change and dynamic interest.</p>

<h1>Using the 2hp 3:1 to Build Full Songs in Eurorack</h1>
<p>The <strong>2hp 3:1</strong> is a compact yet powerful voltage-controlled gate switch and summer. Its ability to route, combine, and algorithmically select gates/clocks makes it an excellent tool for transforming looped ideas into dynamic, evolving full-length tracks. Here’s how you can leverage its features for full song creation in a modular setup:</p>
<hr />
<h2>Core Functionalities Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voltage-controlled selection</strong> of one input (out of three) to a single output</li>
<li><strong>Gate summing</strong> (merge multiple active gates to create polyrhythms or composite triggers)</li>
<li><strong>CV controllable</strong> switching for automating transitions</li>
<li><strong>Gate to trigger conversion</strong> in summing mode for regularized, precisely-timed events</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Techniques for Arranging Full Tracks</h2>
<h3>1. Scene Switching and Section Changes</h3>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Automate introduction, breakdowns, drops, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
Patch three different rhythms (kick, snare, or clock patterns) into the three inputs. Use a sequencer, LFO, or an automation lane (SEL CV) to dynamically select between these inputs at different points in your track. By automating the SEL, the 3:1 will route only the desired rhythmic element, muting or unmuting sections.</p>
<p><strong>Module Interactions:</strong><br />
- <strong>Sequencers (e.g. Pam’s New Workout, Hermod):</strong> Generate CV to select scenes.
- <strong>Clock Dividers/Logic Modules:</strong> Change which gate is fed into each input for more complex transitions.</p>
<hr />
<h3>2. Polyrhythm Generation for Song Development</h3>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Build complexity over time (e.g. intro = simple, mid-section = polyrhythms)</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
Set 3:1 to SUM mode. Input three different rhythmic sources—perhaps one is a master clock, one a divided clock, and one a Euclidean trigger. The output sums concurrent inputs, creating new, evolving trigger streams (polyrhythms) that can fire off envelopes, percussion, or melodic events only later in the track.</p>
<p><strong>Module Interactions:</strong><br />
- <strong>Euclidean Rhythms/Grids:</strong> Patch varied rhythms into inputs.
- <strong>Gate/Trigger-Driven effects:</strong> Output goes to percussive modules or modulation triggers.</p>
<hr />
<h3>3. Arranging Drum Patterns and Song Sections</h3>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Switch drum/perc patterns for verse/chorus structure.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
Feed different drum gate patterns (or clocked LFOs for movement/modulation) into inputs. Use SEL knob and/or SEL CV to “flip” between verses, choruses, fills, and drops live or via automation.</p>
<p><strong>Module Interactions:</strong><br />
- <strong>Drum Modules (e.g., Mutable Peaks, Erica Pico Drums):</strong> Receive pattern changes.
- <strong>CV Recorders:</strong> Capture and automate movement for playback.</p>
<hr />
<h3>4. Live Performance Transitions</h3>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Perform sections or sudden parameter changes hands-on or automated.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
Using the SEL knob or an external controller (joystick/CV keyboard), manually transition between input sources for expressive, performative control over structure and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Module Interactions:</strong><br />
- <strong>Manual CV Generators (e.g., FSR, touch plates):</strong> Control selection in real-time.
- <strong>Switching FX sends or modulation sources for different song movements.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>5. Thematic or Tonal Variation</h3>
<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Change melodic/harmonic patterns without repatching.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong><br />
Send different quantized gate/trigger sequences that transpose, modulate, or open up new musical material at the output, routed to pitch sequencers or harmonic triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Module Interactions:</strong><br />
- <strong>Quantizers/Sequential Switches:</strong> Use output to advance or change pitch values.
- <strong>Arpeggiators:</strong> Change the clocking pattern for new phrases.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Patch Example for Song Structuring</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>IN 1:</strong> Kick pattern (straight 4/4)  </li>
<li><strong>IN 2:</strong> Fill pattern or alternate rhythm  </li>
<li><strong>IN 3:</strong> Hi-hat pattern or breakdown clock  </li>
<li><strong>OUT:</strong> Send to a drum module(s) or mix of voices  </li>
<li><strong>SEL CV:</strong> Automated by your sequencer/automation lane to change song sections</li>
</ol>
<p>This setup enables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intro:</strong> Manual selection of IN 1 (just kick)</li>
<li><strong>Buildup:</strong> Gradually blend to IN 2 with a ramped CV</li>
<li><strong>Chorus/Drop:</strong> SUM mode, engage multiple patterns for high energy</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Flip back to IN 3 for sparse rhythm</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>General Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automate <strong>SEL CV</strong> for precision, or control it by hand for performance jams.</li>
<li>Use external logic or clock modules upstream to sculpt more complex arrangement triggers.</li>
<li>Feed <strong>polyrhythmic outputs</strong> into not just percussion but also to clock S&amp;H, change effects parameters, or drive melody sequencers for total song evolution.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>2hp 3:1</strong> is far more than just a switch—it’s a powerful arrangement and performance tool in a compact case, enabling morphing, evolving, and controlled transitions that turn patterns into complete, narrative-driven modular songs.</p>

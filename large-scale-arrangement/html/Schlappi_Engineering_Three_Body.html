<h1>Using Schlappi Engineering Three Body For Full-Length Songs in Eurorack</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Schlappi Engineering Three Body</strong> module is a highly flexible phase, frequency, and ratio FM engine with three digitally-linked oscillators and deep modulation possibilities. While Eurorack excels at improvisational sound, bass, and lead creation, using a powerful tool like Three Body to architect a coherent, dynamic, full-length track requires strategizing control, structure, and musical evolution.</p>
<p>Below, I provide creative workflows, patch ideas, and modular combinations to help bridge the gap between "cool patch" and <strong>songwriting</strong> with Three Body at the center of your system.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. <strong>Polyphonic and Harmonic Frameworks</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Use Three Body as a Chord Engine or Drone Bank</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Approach:</strong></li>
<li>Set each oscillator to different but musically related ratio modes (e.g., root, third, fifth, or pedal bass + intervals). Use the RATIO and SYNC features for easy tuning.</li>
<li>Modulate ratios rhythmically using sequenced CV, envelopes, or LFOs tied to your song’s sections (verse/chorus contrast, modulation for mood, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> </li>
<li>Build evolving chord beds, shifting drones, or sustained harmonic fields behind leads or vocals through the song.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Stereo Spread and Movement</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Route center oscillator's Sine/Cosine or Saw/Cosaw to stereo channels with dynamically modulated phase offsets for animated, wide stereo pads.</li>
<li>Automate pan or crossfade between outputs using VCAs under sequencer or manual control.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. <strong>Melodic and Bass Material</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Complex FM &amp; Phase Mod Bass/Leads</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use one oscillator in FREE HIGH as the main voice; route other oscillators as FM/phase modulators.</li>
<li>Sequence V/OCT of the main oscillator from your sequencer or quantizer. Use step-modulation or evolving LFOs to alter FM indices/timbre for "verse/chorus" variation or evolving sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Song Section Variation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Use deep FM/PM indices to create noise or percussion textures for breakdown &amp; riser sections.</li>
<li><strong>Drop/Chorus:</strong> Dial indices back to reveal clear bass/melodic content; flip oscillator states for brighter timbres or harmonic progression.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. <strong>Rhythmic &amp; Percussive Elements</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Polyrhythmic Oscillator FM</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Clock or trigger external rhythms into the SYNC input of one oscillator.</li>
<li>Patch differing rhythms into the outer oscillators in ratio mode for shifting polyrhythms and FM clangorous percussive effects.</li>
<li>Use sequential switches or clock dividers/multipliers to create macro song progressions (e.g., verse/chorus A/B using different oscillator sync sources).</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>FM/PM for Clicks, Blips, and Snares</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Exploit through-zero FM and sharp phase modulation for percussive, metallic, or noise-based hits—excellent for "abstract drums" and fills.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. <strong>Macro Song Control &amp; Automation</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Preset Morphing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use voltage-controlled switches or matrix mixers to route modulation and change each oscillator’s mode/state per section.</li>
<li>Scene-based control: For dramatic structure changes, switch oscillator modes with gate/button control (manual or via external sequencer) to jump between setups (e.g., from drone to melody+percussion).</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Envelope and Sequencer Integration</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use multi-stage function generators or complex LFOs (like Maths) to automate fade-ins, evolving FM indexes, or stereo width across song sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Feedback, Cross-Modulation, and Chaos</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Deploy feedback/cross-phase modulation under controlled conditions for rising tension, climactic drops, noise sweeps or breakdowns. Fade in chaos for transitions, then return to order.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. <strong>Tips for Full Song Structure</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Song Transitions:</strong> Use the module’s SYNC and ratio tracking to lock to external clock/LFOs—allowing those clocks to evolve over time (riser, tempo-change, breakdowns).</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Pair with keyframe sequencers (like Malekko Voltage Block, Frap Tools USTA) for parameter animated changes per section.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Use manual or footswitches to switch phase direction, index depths, stereo configurations, or oscillator tracking for live arrangement.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing Considerations:</strong> Use VCAs (for gate/velocity), filters (for subtractive contrast), and stereo mixing for evolving textures and dynamic range.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. <strong>Putting it Together: Example Song Structure</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro:</strong> Slow drone with gradual stereo phase sweep (long LFO on phase CV), subtle evolving FM texture.</li>
<li><strong>Verse:</strong> Main melody in oscillator 1, driven by external sequencer; supporting oscillator in ratio mode for harmony.</li>
<li><strong>Chorus:</strong> High index FM/PM swept in for brash timbre; all three oscillators harmonized; phase modulation increases stereo spread.</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Oscillators cross-modulated, deep FM index for noisy/abstract textures; percussive elements.</li>
<li><strong>Outro:</strong> Fade back to one oscillator, slow stereo phase offset, index back to zero for a clean, pure tone.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Module Combinations for Compositional Control</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sequencers (Korg SQ-1, Make Noise René, Eloquencer):</strong> for main melodies, mod index automation.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Generators/VCAs</strong> for dynamic timbral control.</li>
<li><strong>Switching Modules (Doepfer A-151, Mutable Branches):</strong> for macro section switching.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix Mixers (Doepfer A-138m, Erica Synths Matrix Mixer):</strong> for easy re-routing modulation sources and oscillator cross-modulation per section.</li>
<li><strong>Stereo Mixers &amp; Effects (Mordax Data, FX Aid):</strong> to capture, process, and automate stereo out for space/finalizing.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>By thinking of the Three Body as three “voices” interactively tied together in timbre, harmony, and rhythm, and by <strong>sequencing both its pitch and modulation states</strong> in tandem with your compositional sections, it becomes a dynamic instrument for full-album-scale musical narratives, not just a wild FM drone box.</p>

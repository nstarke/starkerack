<h1>Using the Tiptop Audio MIXZ for Full-Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<p>The Tiptop Audio MIXZ module is more than just a utility mixer—it's a tool that enables large-scale set arrangement and structure within a Eurorack system. Crafting a full song on modular not only involves making interesting sounds but also demands transitions, arrangement, and control. Here’s how to take advantage of MIXZ in a song-oriented workflow:</p>
<h2><strong>Key Features of the MIXZ in Song Building</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual 4-Channel Mixing</strong>: Mixer A and Mixer B allow you to manage separate groups of sounds or signal paths, each with dedicated or summed outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Master Gain &amp; Individual Control</strong>: Mixer A has per-channel gain, Mixer B has a master output control.</li>
<li><strong>Tiptop Bus Mix Integration</strong>: Mix drums or other sources from compatible modules via the bus board, freeing up front-panel patch points and enabling mass muting/enabling via jumpers and the module’s BUS toggle.</li>
<li><strong>Low Noise Summing</strong>: Clean mixing of audio, CV, and gates, important for layered arrangements and song clarity.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Techniques for Creating Full-Length Songs with MIXZ</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Song Sectioning Through Mixer Grouping</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assign Sounds to Mixers</strong>: Send separate voices (like drums, bass, leads, atmospheres) to different mixer sections.<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Drums via BUS Mix + Mixer B, melodic content via Mixer A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Manual Transitions</strong>: Use patch cable insertion/removal to reroute Mixer A out of Mixer B, effectively muting/introducing sections on the fly—a tactile way to handle verse/chorus/bridge changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Live Arrangement via Bus Mix</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selective Drum Muting/Enabling</strong>: With individual modules enabled/disabled on the bus, and the MIXZ BUS switch acting as a global mute, you can bring in or drop out complex percussion sections instantly—ideal for drops, builds, and breakdowns.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Switch</strong>: Flip the BUS switch for dramatic silences or re-entries in your song arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Layering and Spatial Movement</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stereo/FX Sends</strong>: Route Mixer B’s output to effects like delays, reverbs (e.g., Z-DSP in the manual’s example), and fade those effects in/out for dynamic intros, outros, and breakdowns.</li>
<li><strong>Stacked Mixing</strong>: Have Mixer A process your main harmonic content, route into a filter, then into Mixer B with drums. You can gradually build up your song by bringing in extra tracks via the unused channels in each mixer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Scene Creation and Morphing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch Automation</strong>: Use voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs) or mutes post-MIXZ for automated volume fades or switching sections with external sequencers.</li>
<li><strong>External Control</strong>: Use a logic or trigger module to perform “scene” changes by switching which sound groups are routed to the output, or by automating the BUS on/off with external helpers (manual engagement will always be most direct).</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Dynamic Song Progression</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gradual Build-ups</strong>: Slowly raise levels on Mixer A/B, or open the BUS, to create layered introductions.</li>
<li><strong>Breakdowns</strong>: Instantly cut sections by pulling a patch cable from Mixer A’s out (removing its sum from Mixer B), or flipping the BUS off.</li>
<li><strong>Jams and Improvisation</strong>: With 8+ channels + BUS, you can jam and improvise song structure, bringing in or dropping out voices as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Workflow Example: Building a Modular Song</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro:</strong> Bus Mix and all channels off. Fade in atmospheric elements on Mixer A.</li>
<li><strong>Verse:</strong> Bring in drums by flipping BUS switch; add bass via Mixer B.</li>
<li><strong>Chorus:</strong> Patch in Mixer A to Mixer B, combine all voices and bring up FX sends for heightened energy.</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown:</strong> Pull Mixer A out, flip BUS switch off—only atmospheric effects remain.</li>
<li><strong>Build:</strong> Gradually raise levels, re-enable BUS, push signal back into Mixer B for the next section or a final drop.</li>
<li><strong>Outro:</strong> Fade everything out using master gain on Mixer B, or manual level fades.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Pairings with Other Modules</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drum Modules</strong>: All Tiptop drum modules for easy BUS Mix workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Sequencers</strong>: For automating CV/gate changes to dynamics or voice selection.</li>
<li><strong>VCAs &amp; Mute Switches</strong>: Post-MIXZ for more automated section changes.</li>
<li><strong>Envelope Followers/Controllers</strong>: To modulate levels on MIXZ for dynamic builds.</li>
<li><strong>Effects (e.g., Z-DSP, Echo, Reverb)</strong>: For spatial transitions and song development.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>General Tips</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Modular “songs” are about performative arrangement—use MIXZ as your central hub to introduce, remove, and blend elements in real time.</li>
<li>Plan ahead: assign your song elements to different channels or BUS slots to facilitate quick changes on the fly.</li>
<li>Practice transitions! The muscle memory of flipping BUS, patching, and fading will make your live modular songs engaging and cohesive.</li>
</ul>

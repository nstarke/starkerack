<h1>Creative Song Structure Using the BLM Voks Analog Filter</h1>
<p>As a eurorack user, you know creating captivating loops is the easy part—but crafting full-length songs with development and evolution is a bigger challenge. The BLM Voks Analog Filter is based on the sought-after Polivoks topology and has several unique features that can help elevate your sequences into full compositions.</p>
<p>Let’s break down how to use the BLM Voks Analog Filter specifically to arrange and perform full length tracks in the eurorack environment:</p>
<hr />
<h2>Module Features (Quick Recap)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Unstable Brite Mode</strong>—switchable analog character</li>
<li><strong>Internal Limiter Diode</strong> (on/off switch)</li>
<li><strong>12dB LPF</strong> and <strong>6dB BPF</strong>—separate amplified outputs</li>
<li><strong>Attenuated/Direct Audio Inputs</strong>, CV and FM controls</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Strategies for Creating Full-Length Songs</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Automated Filtering for Timbral Variation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morphing Sections:</strong> Use automation (via sequencers or LFOs) on the cutoff frequency and resonance for dynamic intro, verse, chorus, and breakdown sections. Route the filter’s cutoff to a sequencer, envelope, or modulated voltage source.</li>
<li><strong>Brite/Unstable Mode:</strong> Toggle modes at key moments for distinct timbral shifts—e.g., switch into Unstable Brite during a bridge, breakdown, or dramatic climax.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Dual Output Patching for Layering</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>LPF/BPF as Song Layers:</strong> Use the LPF output for bass/melodic content and the BPF for percussive or midrange energy. Fading between them with a mixer or VCA allows you to “build up” and “break down” your song’s density over time.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Processing:</strong> Send one output to effects (delays/reverbs) and another dry for evolving textures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Audio Input Switching for Arrangement Flow</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attenuated vs. Direct Audio Input:</strong> Switch between sources or patch in sub-mixes for subtle or aggressive filter sweeps. Fade elements in and out to introduce or remove motifs within the song.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Performance Macro Controls</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CV &amp; Bipolar FM Input:</strong> Assign macro controls from an external controller or sequencer for drastic live performance moves—think big filter sweeps on drum fills, or resonance stabs to shift energy between sections.</li>
<li><strong>Limiter Diode Switch:</strong> Engage for distortion/drive effects in high-energy sections; disengage for clean build-ups or breakdowns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Evolving Percussive and Tonal Content</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Percussive Filtering:</strong> Run drum or rhythmic content through the BPF, automate cutoff with envelopes/LFOs synced to your beat for evolving grooves.</li>
<li><strong>Thematic Motif:</strong> Apply modulation to a melodic loop's filter cutoff/resonance each time the loop repeats, slowly changing its tone throughout the song to maintain listener interest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Song Structure Using the Voks Filter</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Section</th>
<th>Technique</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Intro</td>
<td>Faded, modulated LPF output, Unstable Brite Mode off, subtle LFO on cutoff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Verse</td>
<td>Activate BPF output, filter gently opens via sequencer, add gentle limiter distortion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chorus</td>
<td>Toggle to Unstable Brite, CV sweeps for brightness, blend LPF+BPF for massive sound</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Breakdown</td>
<td>Kill LPF, use only highly resonant BPF, bring down input volume, switch Limiter off</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bridge</td>
<td>Drastic cutoff/rate modulation from external macro, aggressive use of Limiter and FM input</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Outro</td>
<td>Fade out with heavy resonance LPF, slowly close cutoff, return to clean mode</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Multitracked Sessions:</strong> Use the dual outputs to record multiple layers, then recombine for post-production arrangement flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Scene-based Performance:</strong> Pre-patch scene changes (mode switches, input swaps, modulation routings) and trigger them at key musical moments.</li>
<li><strong>Use Attenuators/VCAs:</strong> Precise control over modulation depth for nuanced, evolving transitions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The BLM Voks Analog Filter is more than a tone-shaper—its flexible patching and unique tonal modes are perfect for building dramatic, evolving transitions and dynamic contrasts essential to full-length song arrangement in modular. Combine smart modulation, careful layering, and bold live control to break free from static loops and unlock powerful, narrative tracks.</p>

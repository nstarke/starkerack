<h1>How to Use Bastl Cinnamon for Creating Full Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<p>Turning a handful of great loops and sounds into a full song is a core challenge of modular synth performance. The Bastl Cinnamon, as a <strong>unique state-variable filter</strong>, is far more than just a resonant "sweetener" for your patches. Here’s how you can use Cinnamon—when combined with other Eurorack modules—to create dynamic, narrative-rich full-length tracks:  </p>
<h2>1. <strong>Morphing Song Sections With Filtering</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Use Cinnamon’s filter type outputs (HP/BP/LP) to sculpt transitions between parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build tension:</strong> Slowly automate the filter cutoff (with LFOs, envelopes, or sequencer CV) to move from a bass-heavy intro (LP), to a vocal/lead-friendly bandpass section, to a bright, driving highpass for the breakdown.</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Use sequencer or automation modules (like Voltage Block, Zadar, or Pam’s New Workout) to modulate cutoff and resonance, creating evolving timbres over time.</li>
<li><strong>Song Transitions:</strong> Flip the Character switches or toggle the Drive for dramatic section changes (e.g., drop from clean LP intro to overdriven BP for chorus).</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. <strong>Turn the Cinnamon Into a Song Element</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Use its self-oscillating capabilities as an <strong>oscillator</strong> for basslines or melodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>With high resonance it self-oscillates; patch the filter's LP out right into your mixer/fx to use as a sine wave oscillator—sequence cutoff with a 1V/oct pitch CV for precise melodies or basslines.</li>
<li><strong>Change character:</strong> Flip Character switches at different song sections for textural shifts, introducing movement and interest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. <strong>Dynamic Groove Processing</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Use Cinnamon after drums or sequenced percussive lines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sidechain tricks:</strong> Use envelope followers or comparators from a kick trigger to CV the cutoff, creating a dynamic “ducking” or pumping effect.</li>
<li><strong>Live FX:</strong> Use manual filter sweeps on percussive elements for transitions, breakdowns, and builds—pair with delay or reverb for further impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. <strong>Performance Macros for Structure</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Use CV presets, pressure pads (like Planar 2), or sequential switch modules to change filter settings, creating A/B/C song sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-patch different output types (HP/LP/BP) to a mixer and fade between them with VCAs or performance mixers for natural transitions.</li>
<li>Use sequential switches or matrix mixers to route audio through Cinnamon only for specific sections, automating song progression.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. <strong>Expressive Filter as Lead Instrument</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Use Cinnamon’s filter resonance "shapes" as vocal lead or synth line, with manual or voltage-control over the Character switches (modifications via mechanical actuators or switch-based logic).</p>
<ul>
<li>Combine with touch controllers, gestural CV generators, or pressure-sensitive pads for live performance and expressive song storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. <strong>Create Variance &amp; Development</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Throughout a song, change not just notes but timbre—slowly bring in Drive, increase Input gain, flip Character switches, automate cutoff sweep rate (e.g., from slow intro swells to rapid rhythmic gating in climax).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance morphing:</strong> Automate resonance for moments of intensity or build, allowing the filter to self-oscillate—then back down for the outro or breakdown.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices—Modular Songwriting Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan structure:</strong> Use a sequencer’s CV/gate tracks or a switch matrix to predictably modulate Cinnamon parameters at section changes—think in verse/chorus/bridge shapes.</li>
<li><strong>Mix parallel paths:</strong> LP/HP/BP outs can be simultaneously processed, sent to their own FX chains, panned, or remixed for wide, layered sections.</li>
<li><strong>Soundsource replacement:</strong> In minimalist patches, Cinnamon can replace oscillators for lean sections (self-oscillation), then return to filtering role for dense sections.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:<br />
The Bastl Cinnamon is deeply modular-friendly: it’s not just a “set-and-forget” filter, but a multidimensional instrument and performance modulator. Use its sheer tonal range, its CV-addressable cutoff, resonance, drive, character switching, and triple outputs to shape entire song arrangements: from ambient intros, creeping breakdowns, dynamic climaxes, and impactful drops. Its power in the context of a thoughtful patch structure, and with modulation/sequencing, makes it ideal for full-song generative or performed music.</p>

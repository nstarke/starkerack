<h1>How To Use the 2hp Slice To Create Full Length Songs in Eurorack</h1>
<p>The <strong>2hp Slice</strong> isn’t just a glitch/beat repeat effect—it’s a dynamic performance and arrangement tool that transforms simple loops and patterns into ever-evolving full-length song structures. Here’s how you can integrate Slice with your modular system to achieve traditional and experimental song forms.</p>
<h2>Understanding Slice As a Performance Tool</h2>
<p>Slice excels at beat repeats, glitching, fills, rhythmic breakdowns, and adding variation—essentials for moving beyond looping riffs and into song development.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong>:
- Audio-rate clocking for creative stuttering and granulation.
- Size control (and CV!) for variable repeat lengths (from 2 bars to sub-16th stutters).
- Gate/trigger input and manual triggering for hands-on (or sequenced) effect activation.
- Latching/momentary modes for performative or automatic usage.
- Triplet toggling for more groovy variations.</p>
<h2>Song Structure Techniques</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Adding Sections (Verses, Choruses, Breakdowns)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beat Repeats as Transitions:</strong><br />
  Use Slice to signal changes between sections. For example, feed your full drum/bass/melody mix through Slice and engage a 1-bar stutter every 8 or 16 bars for a "breakdown" or transition cue.</li>
<li><strong>Build-Ups and Drops:</strong><br />
  Automate the Size CV with envelopes or LFOs to ramp from long repeats (building anticipation) down to very short (1/64 or faster for a snare roll effect), then disengage Slice for a "drop" into the next section.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Fill Generation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduled Fills:</strong><br />
  Use a sequencer or clock-divided trigger to regularly activate the Trig Gate Input at the end of each 4 or 8-bar phrase, creating dynamic fills without manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Randomized Fills:</strong><br />
  Pair with a random CV/gate source (like 2hp Rnd or Mutable Instruments Marbles) on Trig Gate and/or Size CV. This introduces surprise fills or glitch FX, making repeated patterns less predictable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Breaks and Variation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Punch-Ins:</strong><br />
  In latching mode, use the Trig Button as a real-time performance switch to momentarily glitch or repeat any sound/feed at creative moments. Do this to isolate vocals, drums, or even ambient textures.</li>
<li><strong>Momentary Mode:</strong><br />
  For DJ-style "stutter" FX, set to momentary, and tap in live. Automate via CV or with foot controllers for hands-on sets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Layering and Sampling</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture Rearranged Loops:</strong><br />
  Use a sampler/looper (like 2hp Loop or Make Noise Morphagene) after Slice to “resample” your beat-repeated variations. Use these new samples as new sections or drop-ins throughout your song.</li>
<li><strong>Glitched Melodies &amp; Vocals:</strong><br />
  Insert melodic or vocal lines into Slice for unique stuttered, chopped, or triplet-glitched textures. Use modulation (from an LFO, sequencer, or manual CV) to beat-repeat only the last note of a phrase, creating musical "interruptions."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patch Ideas For Song-Level Composition</h2>
<h3><strong>A. Traditional Song Structure With Drum Machine</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Drum pattern to Slice.</li>
<li>Use external sequencer to activate Slice for fills (1/8 note repeats at end of every 8 bars).</li>
<li>Size CV modulated by an envelope for “risers.”</li>
<li>Mix wet/dry post-Slice for subtlety.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>B. Experimental Glitch Section</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mult a master clock to both Slice and your main clock source. Modulate Size with random/S&amp;H CV for erratic, glitchy phrases.</li>
<li>Switch triplet toggle to add math/probability to repeats.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>C. Live Arrangement</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the Trig Button for on-the-fly switch-ups.</li>
<li>Sample output to a looper; switch between “straight” signal and “sliced” for contrasting sections.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pairing Modules</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2hp Rnd</strong>: For random triggers and unpredictable modulation of Size or Gate.</li>
<li><strong>2hp Play/Sampler</strong>: Chop &amp; re-sequence sampled slices as new song sections.</li>
<li><strong>2hp Loop</strong>: Live loop resampled glitch repeats. Layer or reverse them in real time.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Mixer</strong>: Fade between “sliced” and non-sliced versions for dramatic section changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>General Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate engagement</strong>: Use DAW MIDI-to-CV, or programmable clocks/sequencers, to handle complex on/off routines for Slice (such as only activating on chorus entry).</li>
<li><strong>Record everything</strong>: Route Slice output to a DAW/recorder while improvising—cut/paste the best “moments” into your tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Modulate parameters</strong>: Don’t leave Size or Triplet switches static—use modulation for evolving, “alive” effects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>By leveraging <strong>2hp Slice</strong> as a live and automated trigger/resample tool, you unlock the ability to move beyond repetitive phrases and introduce real drama, variation, and narrative to your tracks.</p>

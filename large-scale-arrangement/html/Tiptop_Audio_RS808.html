<h1>Using the Tiptop Audio RS808 (Rimshot/Clavs) to Create Full Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<h2>Quick Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tiptop Audio RS808</strong> is a compact Eurorack adaptation of the Roland TR-808’s iconic Rimshot and Clavs percussion. Beyond just providing those classic sounds, it adds <strong>Pitch</strong> and <strong>Snap</strong> controls, and four sound variations via two switches, together with <strong>Level</strong> and <strong>Accent</strong> knobs. These parameters are designed for real-time manipulation and dynamic expression. (<a href="https://tiptopaudio.com/manuals/RS808.pdf">Product Page &amp; Manual</a>)</p>
<h2>Challenges in Song Arrangement</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beats and grooves</strong> often come easily, but <strong>developing sections, dynamics, and movement</strong> is harder.</li>
<li>Classic grooveboxes and DAWs offer tools like mutes, fills, and automation, which Eurorack can lack unless you build similar structures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategies for Song Structure with RS808</h2>
<h3>1. Sound Variation for Song Sections</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use the switches</strong> to swap between the four sound types (Rimshot, Clavs, Click, or Mixed) for different song sections (intro, verse, chorus, bridge).</li>
<li><strong>Automate</strong> these switches with voltage-controlled switches or robot fingers (modules like Doepfer A-150 or Erica Synths Sequential Switch) to programmatically change RS808’s timbre during your song.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Dynamic Accent Programming</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accent input</strong> allows you to send selective gate signals, accentuating specific beats or notes.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>sequencer</strong> (e.g., Metropolis, Eloquencer, Pam's New Workout, or a trigger sequencer) with accent outputs to create dynamic grooves.</li>
<li><strong>Accent knob</strong> provides very fine volume changes. Automate it with CV (using a VC-attenuator in line, for example) for evolving song dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Modulating Pitch and Snap</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitch and Snap</strong> are not on the original 808, so play these to your advantage!</li>
<li><strong>Send slow LFOs, envelopes, or sequenced CV</strong> to Pitch or Snap to create movement (e.g., raising Snap for breakdowns, or modulating Pitch for fills and transitions).</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Rhythmic Arrangement and Switching</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use sequential switches or switch/mute modules to <strong>bring the RS808 in and out of the mix</strong>. This is perfect for builds, drops, or changing up song sections.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>trigger/gate delay</strong> module for offsetting RS808 patterns across your track, creating variation and fills.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Layering and Panning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mix the RS808 with other percussive modules (e.g., Tiptop’s other 808/909 or analog drum voices) and <strong>pan</strong> or <strong>EQ</strong> rimshots/clavs for stereo width and interest.</li>
<li>For longer tracks, automate the mixing of the RS808 via CV-controllable mixers for dynamic song energy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Song Progression with Sequencers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Program distinct sequences for Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc., and use a <strong>pattern chaining or song mode</strong> (if your sequencer has it) to progress through sections.</li>
<li>Sync pattern changes to timbral changes on the RS808 for cohesive song arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Performance: Manual Controls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use your hands! The RS808’s physical knobs make it ideal for <strong>real-time manipulation</strong> – build energy by increasing Accent, raising Snap or Pitch on breakdowns, and muting notes on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example Song Arrangement Flow</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro</strong>: Sparse rimshot (RS808, both switches down), low Snap and Level.</li>
<li><strong>Verse</strong>: Add Clavs (switches up) with moderate Snap, subtle Accent automation.</li>
<li><strong>Chorus/Drop</strong>: Max Accent, modulate Snap and Pitch, mixed switches for unique timbre.</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown</strong>: Strip back to only RS808 “Click" (Left down, Right up), automate Snap for effect.</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong>: Bring in layered rimshots, increase Snap and Pitch steadily, then back to full groove.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example Patch Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trigger Sequencer</strong> (for Gate In and Accent In)</li>
<li><strong>Voltage-controlled Switch</strong> (to automate RS808 mode)</li>
<li><strong>CV Source</strong> (LFO/Envelope for Pitch/Snap)</li>
<li><strong>Mixer &amp; Panning Modules</strong> (for song dynamics)</li>
<li><strong>Beat clock divider/multiplier</strong> (change patterns for song sections)</li>
<li><strong>Mute or gate/trigger shuffling modules</strong> (for fills/transitions)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The <strong>RS808</strong> becomes powerful in songs when <strong>sequenced creatively and modulated</strong> in real time or by automation. Combine it with muting, CV, switching, and sequencing modules to transcend simple loops, bringing dynamic, evolving song structure to your modular live set or recordings.</p>

<h1>Creating Full-Length Songs with Brst in a Eurorack System</h1>
<p>The 2hp Brst module is a powerful, compact voltage-controlled burst generator and trigger delay. Often, the challenge in Eurorack composition isn’t making inspiring short loops, but transforming those loops into compelling, full-length tracks. Below are ways Brst can help you introduce structure, variation, and movement in your songs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Functions Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burst Generation</strong>: Emit a programmable stream of triggers per incoming gate.</li>
<li><strong>Voltage Control</strong>: Modulate the number of pulses and rate via CV.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger Delay</strong>: Create time-shifted rhythmic elements, even omitting the initial hit for creative patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat Flexibility</strong>: From 1 up to 32 triggers per burst for anything from fills to flurries.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Strategies for Full-Length Song Arrangements</h2>
<h3>1. Dynamic Fills &amp; Drum Accents</h3>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Patch Brst's OUT to a drum sound trigger input (e.g., snare or clap). Use sporadic, resettable gates from a sequencer at key moments (e.g., pre-chorus, chorus starts).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use CV to vary the pulse count for each fill.</li>
<li>Automate the RATE with a sequencer, LFO, or random source for fills that change feel every time.</li>
<li>Use the TRIG TOGGLE to include/omit the initial drum hit for call-and-response effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this adds:</strong> Variety and excitement, unique fill each time, breaks monotony.</p>
<h3>2. Humanizing Repetitive Sequences</h3>
<p>Patch Brst between a master clock and some event triggers (e.g., hi-hats, plucks).</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust RATE with subtle modulation (slow LFO, envelope) to introduce slight timing swings, randomization.</li>
<li>Inject bursts at different pulse counts to “shuffle” percussion—great for IDM/experimental styles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this adds:</strong> Keeps robotic patterns feeling alive and unpredictable.</p>
<h3>3. Transition FX and Risers</h3>
<p>Route Brst’s bursts to trigger envelopes or function generators patched to modulate filters, VCAs, or effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>At moments of transition, a single gate could trigger 16 fast Brst pulses, creating a “ramp up” of modulation— for a whoosh, reverb build, or synth morph.</li>
<li>Use external CV (from sequencer scenes, random sources, or manual changes) to shape each transition differently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this adds:</strong> Punctuates sections, smooths out stagnant song parts, heightens tension/releases.</p>
<h3>4. Layering and Section Differentiation</h3>
<p>Assign Brst to multiple drum voices, with different PULSES and RATE settings per song section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Verse: 1–3 bursts on toms.</li>
<li>Chorus: Up to 8 pulses on claps.</li>
<li>Bridge: Omitted initial triggers for off-grid, syncopated feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scene or pattern-based sequencers can automate Brst’s role, turning a basic beat into evolving, sectioned drum arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>What this adds:</strong> Clear section changes over time, a sense of movement and storytelling.</p>
<h3>5. Triggering Melodic or Harmonic Events</h3>
<p>Patch Brst bursts into a quantizer or melodic trigger path. For every gate from your main sequencer, you could get flurries of notes or arpeggios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vary pulse numbers/rate with CV as above.</li>
<li>Pair with random CV sources for ever-shifting melodic clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this adds:</strong> Richer, evolving melodies and harmonies, suitable for bridges, outros, or breakdowns.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Workflow Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate Everything:</strong> Use sequencers and modulation sources to change Brst panel settings over the course of your song.</li>
<li><strong>Layer with Other Modules:</strong> Pair Brst with logic, mixers, random modules, and sequential switches for maximal variety.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate with Performance:</strong> Manual bursts (tapped or gated from a controller) are amazing for live builds and breakdowns.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong><br />
Brst transforms static, repetitive patterns into dynamic, humanized, and structurally varied music—ideal for turning short jams into complete tracks.</p>

<h1>Expert Sleepers ES-9: Creating Full-Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<p>The Expert Sleepers ES-9 is a powerful audio interface tailored for Eurorack environments, combining multichannel audio I/O, robust internal mixing, and flexible MIDI connectivity. While its primary role is often as a bridge to a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or iOS device, careful use of its features can play a key part in composing, structuring, and performing complete modular songs.</p>
<p>Below, I’ll analyze features from the manual and propose creative strategies—especially for arranging and structuring full-length songs when integrated with other modules.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Features &amp; Their Musical Value</h2>
<h3>Multichannel Audio Input/Output</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>14 DC-coupled inputs / 12 outputs (8x 3.5mm DC-coupled, 2x balanced)</strong> </li>
<li><strong>USB audio interface (16 in / 16 out)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mixers, busses, flexible routing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How this Helps:</strong><br />
Route multiple voices (e.g. basslines, lead, percussion, effects, CV) into individual DAW tracks or sum and remix inside the ES-9, allowing you to record and automate multiple stems for advanced song arrangement.</p>
<h3>Internal Mixers &amp; Routing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two 8x8 mixers (if S/PDIF is disabled)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Routing between physical IO, USB, busses, and mixers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Song Structuring Tricks:</strong>
- <strong>Dynamic Song Parts:</strong> Mute/unmute mixer channels, swap between two saved configurations (hosted/standalone), or use MIDI to fade/move sounds between parts (intro, drop, breakdown, etc).
- <strong>On-the-fly Remixes:</strong> Change what is sent to the main/phones/aux outs—e.g., drop out the kick, boost the reverb return, add new timbres.</p>
<h3>Scene/Configuration Switching</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-hold main knob switches between two pre-saved configurations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arrangement Use:</strong><br />
Instantly switch between two entire routing/mixing setups—perfect for toggling between "A" (e.g., verse) and "B" (chorus/breakdown) patterns for live sets.</p>
<h3>MIDI CC Mixer Control</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote mix automation from a MIDI controller/sequencer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Up to 64 CCs for fader/pan/level control</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Uses:</strong>
- Use an external MIDI sequencer (e.g., Arturia Beatstep Pro) to mute, solo, or fade in/out stems over a song’s timeline.
- Program pattern-based scene changes by sending CCs for arrangement (e.g., silent breakdown, FX send bursts, complex transitions).</p>
<h3>DAW &amp; Hybrid Workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tight integration with DAW/iOS for multitrack I/O</strong></li>
<li><strong>Immediate resampling and live capture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Full Songs:</strong>
- Record modular stems in the DAW, arrange/copy segments, add effects, and then, if desired, send back to modular for hybrid performances or reprocessing.
- Automate ES-9’s mix via your DAW, essentially treating the modular setup as a DAW-recallable instrument.</p>
<h3>S/PDIF Digital &amp; Headphone Out</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital expandability; independent headphone cueing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use for Structure:</strong>
- Route a special element (click track, cue mix) to headphones only—practice transitions, monitor a sidechain beat, or solo elements for performance.</p>

<h2>Practical Song Arrangement Techniques with the ES-9</h2>
<h4>1. <strong>Modular Song Mode Swapper</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Save two radically different routings/mixes:  </li>
<li><strong>Config 1:</strong> Standard groove/verse structure.</li>
<li><strong>Config 2:</strong> Add/drop voices, reverb wash, FX, or switch to a breakdown.</li>
<li>Use the push-button to fluidly shift between these during a live set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. <strong>MIDI Scenes &amp; Automated Mixing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Set up MIDI CC sequences to:</li>
<li>Gradually transpose synth voices.</li>
<li>Mute or fade percussion.</li>
<li>Send CV/LFOs to modulate pan/level of voices in time with the song.</li>
<li>Use an external MIDI sequencer or DAW to automate structure, “playing” your mix and transitions live or from pre-programmed clips.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. <strong>Hybrid Sequencing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sequence voices in the modular.</li>
<li>Multitrack record into DAW via ES-9, edit/cut/paste to form structure.</li>
<li>Route DAW tracks back to modular for real-time filter/EQ/FX via ES-9, recompose, and re-record for a hybrid electroacoustic feel.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. <strong>Performance-Ready Live Sets</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Assign:</li>
<li>Background textures and evolving pads to one mixer.</li>
<li>Percussion/bass to another.</li>
<li>Alternate between “mix blocks,” use ES-9’s routing/summing to crossfade, perform drop-ins, or quickly mute/unmute entire voices without repatching.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. <strong>Advanced Song Evolution</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ES-9’s internal EQ, DC offset, and mix smoothing can be modulated live or via MIDI, meaning your mix can evolve in character (more saturated, filtered, etc.).</li>
<li>Use mix smoothing to avoid clicks/pops during abrupt changes, ensuring pro-sounding transitions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Example Song Structure Workflow</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build Modular Patch</strong>: Multiple voice generators and sequencers patched into ES-9 inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Record Modular Jam via ES-9</strong>: Capture stems to DAW, improvising with muting/mixer controls.</li>
<li><strong>Arrange in DAW</strong>: Chop, repeat, and move sections for song length.</li>
<li><strong>Automate Mix (Optional)</strong>: Use DAW or MIDI controller to morph the song—fading out the bass, isolating the melody, layering FX, or morphing the structure.</li>
<li><strong>Bounce to Stereo</strong>: Play back through ES-9, reprocess with filters/FX, or perform on stage, using configuration switching for bold changes.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Integration Ideas with Other Eurorack Modules</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Switches/Sequential Switches</strong>: Use with ES-9 mixers for stepping/bursting between sound sources.</li>
<li><strong>Sampler/Looper Modules</strong>: Sample phrases, then remix and re-perform sections through ES-9.</li>
<li><strong>Function Generators/LFOs</strong>: Modulate mixer channel levels for organic, evolving arrangements.</li>
<li><strong>Logic/Trigger Modules</strong>: Program automated scene changes, or even patch triggers to send MIDI through breakout, interacting with external gear.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The ES-9 isn’t just a transparent digital I/O—it’s a compositional and performative tool, able to structure and morph full-length modular tracks via mixing, MIDI, and hybrid workflows. Its flexibility enables you to "play the song" just as much as any voice or sequencer modules in your rack.</p>

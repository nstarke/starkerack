<h1>Using the 2hp Delay in Full-Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<p>Transitioning from looping beats and appealing basslines to a cohesive, evolving full-length track in modular can be a challenge. The 2hp Delay, as described in the manual above, is a flexible delay processor with CV (control voltage) over all key parameters: delay time, feedback, and mix. This flexibility is helpful not just for sound design, but for structure, movement, and evolving arrangements within a modular song. Below are some ways you can incorporate this delay module to help shape and expand your tracks into fully realized pieces.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Core Functions Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delay Time (TIME):</strong> From very short to nearly 2s, CV controllable.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback (FDBK):</strong> From subtle repeats to infinite looping, CV controllable.</li>
<li><strong>Mix:</strong> Blend dry/wet signals, CV controllable.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Strategic Uses for Song Structure</h2>
<h3>1. Evolving Textures and Sections</h3>
<p><strong>Automate Parameters with Sequencers or LFOs:</strong>
- Send slow-moving LFOs or sequencer CVs into the TIME, FDBK, and MIX CV inputs.
- Example: Increase MIX and FDBK in breakdowns for atmospheric washes, then snap back to dry signal for drops or chorus sections.</p>
<h3>2. Transitions &amp; Builds</h3>
<p><strong>Delay as a Transition Tool:</strong>
- Gradually raise feedback and wet mix at song "breaks" to create decaying, smeared echoes or pseudo-reverb effects.
- Automate TIME for pitch-shifting or tape-speed effects between sections.</p>
<p><strong>Scene Changes with Delay:</strong>
- Use a voltage offset or switch module to change TIME/MIX/FDBK presets instantly between "verse" and "chorus" song parts.</p>
<h3>3. Creating Movement and Interest</h3>
<p><strong>Stereo Movement:</strong>
- If you have two delay modules or can mult the output, pan short and long delays left/right for evolving stereo fields.</p>
<p><strong>Rhythmic Delay:</strong>
- Sync short delay times to clock multipliers/dividers so echo patterns complement your rhythm.</p>
<h3>4. Generative &amp; Textural Use</h3>
<p><strong>Looping Ambient Beds:</strong>
- With FDBK at or near maximum, the module can “freeze” or self-oscillate echoes. Use this for evolving foundations, drone backdrops, or to slowly layer sounds during long-form arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Live Performance:</strong>
- Manually tweak controls for real-time dub-style effects during improvisation, feeding sections in and out with MIX/FDBK.</p>
<h3>5. Multitimbral &amp; Dynamic Song Arrangements</h3>
<p><strong>Parallel Processing:</strong>
- Mult a melodic or rhythmic track, send one signal through Delay and one dry. Use VCAs/mixers to crossfade these sources over song sections.</p>
<p><strong>Trigger-Based Modulation:</strong>
- Use envelopes or trigger-based stepped CV (e.g., from a gate sequencer) to bump FDBK/MIX, causing bursts of echo on particular measures or accents.</p>

<h2>Example Patch for a Full Track</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drum Beat:</strong> Sequenced as main groove.</li>
<li><strong>Bass Line:</strong> Dry most of the time; send occasional fills through Delay with increased MIX and FDBK during drops.</li>
<li><strong>Lead/Melodic Voice:</strong> Route through Delay. Automate TIME and FDBK for intro/outro and bridge sections.</li>
<li><strong>Atmospheric Pads:</strong> Sample and hold or manual knob sweeps into all CV inputs create shifting, evolving textures.</li>
<li><strong>Master Section:</strong> Fade FX return in and out with VCA for song structure—wet during breakdowns, dry for climax/groove.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Tips for Song-Length Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate With Intent:</strong> Plan CV automation as “arrangement lanes,” not just modulation.</li>
<li><strong>Save "Infinity":</strong> Reserve maximum feedback for climactic moments (breakdowns, buildups, outros).</li>
<li><strong>Morph or Crossfade:</strong> Use VCAs and mixers to seamlessly shift between wet/dry or layered voices.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 2hp Delay’s CV-controllability is not just for fun modulations, but becomes essential for real song-building within eurorack. Treat your delay parameters as compositional tools, not just effects. With creative CV routing, switching, and performance gestures, you’ll unlock a toolkit for evolving, dynamic modular songs.</p>

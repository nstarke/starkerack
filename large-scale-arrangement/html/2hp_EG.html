<h1>Using the 2hp EG Envelope Generator to Create Full-Length Eurorack Songs</h1>
<p>Many modular synth users find it easy to patch up an inspiring loop, but extending those ideas into dynamic, structured, full-length songs is more challenging. The 2hp EG is a compact, flexible envelope generator with unique features for dynamic patching. Here's how you can leverage it creatively, in combination with other modules, to build evolving, musical compositions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Summary: What Makes the 2hp EG Special?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra wide envelope times:</strong> 3ms to 11 minutes per stage (attack/decay)</li>
<li><strong>CV over attack &amp; decay:</strong> Lets you automate envelope shapes</li>
<li><strong>Switchable linear/exponential response:</strong> For precise or musical contour shaping</li>
<li><strong>Built-in attenuator (AMP knob):</strong> For scaling the envelope amount</li>
<li><strong>Tiny size (2HP):</strong> Slot anywhere in your rack for modulation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Song-Creation with 2hp EG</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Song Structure with Evolving Envelopes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the orbital-long envelope times for slow builds and releases—set an attack or decay to several minutes to open up a filter or VCA slowly, creating natural intro, outro, or breakdown sections.</li>
<li>Use external sequencers or clock dividers to send trigger/gate signals for section changes (e.g., changing from verse to chorus, breakdowns, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Dynamic Transitions and Automation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Patch slow LFOs, random voltages, or scene-based sequencer lanes into the attack/decay CV inputs to morph envelope timing throughout your performance—making for less repetitive, more 'performed' modulations.</li>
<li>Example: As a chorus approaches, use triggered CV to extend the decay for longer reverb tails or swelling sounds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Expressive Drum Variation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the EG as a snappy envelope for drum voices—triggered by rhythm sequencers. Vary the attack/decay CV for fills, accents, and humanizing drum envelopes.</li>
<li>For breakdowns, increase the decay for ride cymbals or hats to wash out the groove, then snap it back for returns to the main beat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Animated Melodic Motifs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Patch the envelope to modulate a filter cutoff or oscillator level, changing contour per sequence step. CV control can swing the mood from staccato, plucked lines to smoothed, pad-like swells.</li>
<li>Linear/expo toggle gives contrast between percussive (expo) and smoother (linear) phrasing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Manual or Automated "Morphing"</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Switch envelope shapes (linear/expo) live, or send triggers/gates from performance-oriented controllers to the EG trigger input—using the AMP for smooth fade-ins/outs, or abrupt drops, ideal for live improvisation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Layered Patches &amp; Scene Changes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use multiple EGs (or mult triggered output) for complex, layered modulation across your system, all synced to master timing, or offset for polymetric feel.</li>
<li>Sequence EG parameters alongside your main CV sequences for truly dynamic patches, moving easily between different energy sections in your song.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workflow Tips for Composing Songs with 2hp EG</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan Sections</strong>: Use envelope stage lengths and CV to denote verses, choruses, breakdowns, and transitions. Map your patch so rhythm, lead, FX, and dynamics shift across song sections.</li>
<li><strong>Hands-on Control</strong>: Put the AMP or CV ranges within reach for manual tweaks during performance or live takes.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Pair with step sequencers, LFOs, or control modules to automate dynamic changes—think of each EG parameter as a macro for your sound.</li>
<li><strong>Layer</strong>: Use several EGs (or copies of the 2hp EG) for impact on multiple layers at once—e.g., bringing in FX, modulating VCA, and filter cutoff per section.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>By using the 2hp EG's long timing, voltage control, and morphable contour <strong>creatively in song construction</strong>—rather than just set-and-forget transient shaping—you unlock a whole new level of patch-based composition. Every song section can have unique motion and energy, transforming your modular jams into actual finished tracks.</p>

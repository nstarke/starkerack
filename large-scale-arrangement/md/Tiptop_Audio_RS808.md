# Using the Tiptop Audio RS808 (Rimshot/Clavs) to Create Full Length Eurorack Songs

## Quick Overview

The **Tiptop Audio RS808** is a compact Eurorack adaptation of the Roland TR-808’s iconic Rimshot and Clavs percussion. Beyond just providing those classic sounds, it adds **Pitch** and **Snap** controls, and four sound variations via two switches, together with **Level** and **Accent** knobs. These parameters are designed for real-time manipulation and dynamic expression. ([Product Page & Manual](https://tiptopaudio.com/manuals/RS808.pdf))

## Challenges in Song Arrangement

- **Beats and grooves** often come easily, but **developing sections, dynamics, and movement** is harder.
- Classic grooveboxes and DAWs offer tools like mutes, fills, and automation, which Eurorack can lack unless you build similar structures.

## Strategies for Song Structure with RS808

### 1. Sound Variation for Song Sections

- **Use the switches** to swap between the four sound types (Rimshot, Clavs, Click, or Mixed) for different song sections (intro, verse, chorus, bridge).
- **Automate** these switches with voltage-controlled switches or robot fingers (modules like Doepfer A-150 or Erica Synths Sequential Switch) to programmatically change RS808’s timbre during your song.

### 2. Dynamic Accent Programming

- **Accent input** allows you to send selective gate signals, accentuating specific beats or notes.
- Use a **sequencer** (e.g., Metropolis, Eloquencer, Pam's New Workout, or a trigger sequencer) with accent outputs to create dynamic grooves.
- **Accent knob** provides very fine volume changes. Automate it with CV (using a VC-attenuator in line, for example) for evolving song dynamics.

### 3. Modulating Pitch and Snap

- **Pitch and Snap** are not on the original 808, so play these to your advantage!
- **Send slow LFOs, envelopes, or sequenced CV** to Pitch or Snap to create movement (e.g., raising Snap for breakdowns, or modulating Pitch for fills and transitions).

### 4. Rhythmic Arrangement and Switching

- Use sequential switches or switch/mute modules to **bring the RS808 in and out of the mix**. This is perfect for builds, drops, or changing up song sections.
- Use a **trigger/gate delay** module for offsetting RS808 patterns across your track, creating variation and fills.

### 5. Layering and Panning

- Mix the RS808 with other percussive modules (e.g., Tiptop’s other 808/909 or analog drum voices) and **pan** or **EQ** rimshots/clavs for stereo width and interest.
- For longer tracks, automate the mixing of the RS808 via CV-controllable mixers for dynamic song energy.

### 6. Song Progression with Sequencers

- Program distinct sequences for Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc., and use a **pattern chaining or song mode** (if your sequencer has it) to progress through sections.
- Sync pattern changes to timbral changes on the RS808 for cohesive song arrangement.

### 7. Performance: Manual Controls

- Use your hands! The RS808’s physical knobs make it ideal for **real-time manipulation** – build energy by increasing Accent, raising Snap or Pitch on breakdowns, and muting notes on the fly.

## Example Song Arrangement Flow

1. **Intro**: Sparse rimshot (RS808, both switches down), low Snap and Level.
2. **Verse**: Add Clavs (switches up) with moderate Snap, subtle Accent automation.
3. **Chorus/Drop**: Max Accent, modulate Snap and Pitch, mixed switches for unique timbre.
4. **Breakdown**: Strip back to only RS808 “Click" (Left down, Right up), automate Snap for effect.
5. **Build**: Bring in layered rimshots, increase Snap and Pitch steadily, then back to full groove.

## Example Patch Suggestions

- **Trigger Sequencer** (for Gate In and Accent In)
- **Voltage-controlled Switch** (to automate RS808 mode)
- **CV Source** (LFO/Envelope for Pitch/Snap)
- **Mixer & Panning Modules** (for song dynamics)
- **Beat clock divider/multiplier** (change patterns for song sections)
- **Mute or gate/trigger shuffling modules** (for fills/transitions)

## Final Thoughts

The **RS808** becomes powerful in songs when **sequenced creatively and modulated** in real time or by automation. Combine it with muting, CV, switching, and sequencing modules to transcend simple loops, bringing dynamic, evolving song structure to your modular live set or recordings.

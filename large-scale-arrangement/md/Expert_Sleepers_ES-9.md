# Expert Sleepers ES-9: Creating Full-Length Eurorack Songs

The Expert Sleepers ES-9 is a powerful audio interface tailored for Eurorack environments, combining multichannel audio I/O, robust internal mixing, and flexible MIDI connectivity. While its primary role is often as a bridge to a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or iOS device, careful use of its features can play a key part in composing, structuring, and performing complete modular songs.

Below, I’ll analyze features from the manual and propose creative strategies—especially for arranging and structuring full-length songs when integrated with other modules.

## Key Features & Their Musical Value

### Multichannel Audio Input/Output
- **14 DC-coupled inputs / 12 outputs (8x 3.5mm DC-coupled, 2x balanced)** 
- **USB audio interface (16 in / 16 out)**
- **Mixers, busses, flexible routing**

**How this Helps:**  
Route multiple voices (e.g. basslines, lead, percussion, effects, CV) into individual DAW tracks or sum and remix inside the ES-9, allowing you to record and automate multiple stems for advanced song arrangement.

### Internal Mixers & Routing
- **Two 8x8 mixers (if S/PDIF is disabled)**
- **Routing between physical IO, USB, busses, and mixers**

**Song Structuring Tricks:**
- **Dynamic Song Parts:** Mute/unmute mixer channels, swap between two saved configurations (hosted/standalone), or use MIDI to fade/move sounds between parts (intro, drop, breakdown, etc).
- **On-the-fly Remixes:** Change what is sent to the main/phones/aux outs—e.g., drop out the kick, boost the reverb return, add new timbres.

### Scene/Configuration Switching
- **Push-hold main knob switches between two pre-saved configurations**

**Arrangement Use:**  
Instantly switch between two entire routing/mixing setups—perfect for toggling between "A" (e.g., verse) and "B" (chorus/breakdown) patterns for live sets.

### MIDI CC Mixer Control
- **Remote mix automation from a MIDI controller/sequencer**
- **Up to 64 CCs for fader/pan/level control**

**Practical Uses:**
- Use an external MIDI sequencer (e.g., Arturia Beatstep Pro) to mute, solo, or fade in/out stems over a song’s timeline.
- Program pattern-based scene changes by sending CCs for arrangement (e.g., silent breakdown, FX send bursts, complex transitions).

### DAW & Hybrid Workflow
- **Tight integration with DAW/iOS for multitrack I/O**
- **Immediate resampling and live capture**

**For Full Songs:**
- Record modular stems in the DAW, arrange/copy segments, add effects, and then, if desired, send back to modular for hybrid performances or reprocessing.
- Automate ES-9’s mix via your DAW, essentially treating the modular setup as a DAW-recallable instrument.

### S/PDIF Digital & Headphone Out
- **Digital expandability; independent headphone cueing**

**Use for Structure:**
- Route a special element (click track, cue mix) to headphones only—practice transitions, monitor a sidechain beat, or solo elements for performance.

## Practical Song Arrangement Techniques with the ES-9

#### 1. **Modular Song Mode Swapper**
- Save two radically different routings/mixes:  
  - **Config 1:** Standard groove/verse structure.
  - **Config 2:** Add/drop voices, reverb wash, FX, or switch to a breakdown.
- Use the push-button to fluidly shift between these during a live set.

#### 2. **MIDI Scenes & Automated Mixing**
- Set up MIDI CC sequences to:
  - Gradually transpose synth voices.
  - Mute or fade percussion.
  - Send CV/LFOs to modulate pan/level of voices in time with the song.
- Use an external MIDI sequencer or DAW to automate structure, “playing” your mix and transitions live or from pre-programmed clips.

#### 3. **Hybrid Sequencing**
- Sequence voices in the modular.
- Multitrack record into DAW via ES-9, edit/cut/paste to form structure.
- Route DAW tracks back to modular for real-time filter/EQ/FX via ES-9, recompose, and re-record for a hybrid electroacoustic feel.

#### 4. **Performance-Ready Live Sets**
- Assign:
  - Background textures and evolving pads to one mixer.
  - Percussion/bass to another.
- Alternate between “mix blocks,” use ES-9’s routing/summing to crossfade, perform drop-ins, or quickly mute/unmute entire voices without repatching.

#### 5. **Advanced Song Evolution**
- The ES-9’s internal EQ, DC offset, and mix smoothing can be modulated live or via MIDI, meaning your mix can evolve in character (more saturated, filtered, etc.).
- Use mix smoothing to avoid clicks/pops during abrupt changes, ensuring pro-sounding transitions.

## Example Song Structure Workflow

1. **Build Modular Patch**: Multiple voice generators and sequencers patched into ES-9 inputs.
2. **Record Modular Jam via ES-9**: Capture stems to DAW, improvising with muting/mixer controls.
3. **Arrange in DAW**: Chop, repeat, and move sections for song length.
4. **Automate Mix (Optional)**: Use DAW or MIDI controller to morph the song—fading out the bass, isolating the melody, layering FX, or morphing the structure.
5. **Bounce to Stereo**: Play back through ES-9, reprocess with filters/FX, or perform on stage, using configuration switching for bold changes.

## Integration Ideas with Other Eurorack Modules

- **Switches/Sequential Switches**: Use with ES-9 mixers for stepping/bursting between sound sources.
- **Sampler/Looper Modules**: Sample phrases, then remix and re-perform sections through ES-9.
- **Function Generators/LFOs**: Modulate mixer channel levels for organic, evolving arrangements.
- **Logic/Trigger Modules**: Program automated scene changes, or even patch triggers to send MIDI through breakout, interacting with external gear.

## Conclusion

The ES-9 isn’t just a transparent digital I/O—it’s a compositional and performative tool, able to structure and morph full-length modular tracks via mixing, MIDI, and hybrid workflows. Its flexibility enables you to "play the song" just as much as any voice or sequencer modules in your rack.

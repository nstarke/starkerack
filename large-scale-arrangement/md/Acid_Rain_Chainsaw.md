# How to Use Chainsaw in Full-Length Eurorack Songs

**Acid Rain Technology Chainsaw** is a stereo, polyphonic, super-oscillator module. It specializes in lush super-saw and super-square textures, spanning three independent oscillators, each with 7 detunable waves per voice. This makes it a powerful tool for song-making beyond basic riffs or beats. Here's a breakdown of how you can leverage Chainsaw—together with other modules—to build cohesive, evolving full-length songs.

---

## 1. **Polyphonic Chording and Voice Management**

**What Chainsaw does:**  
- Offers 3 voices with 7 waves each.
- Each voice is pitch-addressable via 1V/oct CV inputs.

**How to use in songs:**  
- **Chord Progressions**: Use sequencers or polyphonic MIDI-to-CV interfaces (e.g., Polyend Poly2, Expert Sleepers FH-2) to send polyphonic information to the three pitch CV inputs. Develop song structure by automating chord changes, inversions, or voicings.
- **Evolving Timbral Layers**: Automate the wave morphing (saw ↔ square) over time for developing timbres across verses, choruses, and bridges. Use sequencer or random voltage sources into the morph CV for gradual or sudden changes.

---

## 2. **Big Stereo Pads and Transitions**

**What Chainsaw does:**  
- Wide, swirling stereo spread, especially with 21 detuned waves.

**How to use in songs:**  
- **Layered Pads**: Use both stereo outputs, send them to a stereo mixer or audio interface. Modulate detune amount (manually or with LFOs/envelopes) for dreamy intros, breakdowns, or transitions.
- **Energy Shifts**: At song climaxes or drops, automate detune to max for chaos or return to unison for clarity.

---

## 3. **Building Sections with Morphing and Modulation**

**What Chainsaw does:**  
- Morph wave shape from super saw to square via knob or CV.

**How to use in songs:**  
- **Section Differentiation**: Morph slowly in the background to mark different sections. E.g., intro is a bright saw pad, verse morphs towards square for a hollow/woody tone, chorus brings back the lush saw.
- **FM for Extra Movement**: Use envelopes, LFOs, or another melodic oscillator patched to the FM input to introduce timbral complexity at key moments—sync'd to song events.

---

## 4. **Mono Bass, Leads, and Multi-Part Arrangements**

**What Chainsaw does:**  
- Voices can be independent (if CV’d) OR unison.

**How to use in songs:**  
- **Bass/Lead Splitting**: Use one voice for bass, others for leads or chords. Process each output separately (pan, filter, effects).
- **Single Output for Simplicity**: For tight mono lines, use just one output; for lush full mixes, use both for stereo spread.

---

## 5. **Dynamic Control & Automation**

To make a static loop evolve into a song:
- **Integrate with Modulators**: Modulate detune, morph, FM, or even root note with LFOs, envelopes, or random sources (Tides, Maths, Pam's, etc.).
- **Manual Performance**: Use the encoder for live key changes or pitch sweeps. Engage C1-reset for musical resets after dramatic moments.

## 6. **Patch Ideas for Song Structure**

### A. **Morphing Pad Section**
- **Sequencer** → v/o 1+2+3 (play chords)
- **Slow LFO** → Morph CV (wave mode sweeps)
- **Envelope** → Detune CV (get swirling spreads during transitions)

### B. **Verse-chorus Bass/Lead Split**
- **Bass Sequence** → v/o 1
- **Lead Sequence** → v/o 2
- **Chords** → v/o 3, with wide detune and morph for texture
- Optionally run each output through different FX chains for distinct song sections.

### C. **Transitions**
- **FM Input**: Patch random voltage or synced looping envelope for crunchy transitions or risers/falls.
- **Alternate Unison/Detuned**: Use envelope or stepped LFO to switch detune from unison (tight) to wide (epic) for A→B section changes.

---

## 7. **Combining with Other Modules**

- **Sequencers**: Five12 Vector, Nerdseq, or any polyphonic sequencer for full arrangements.
- **Modulation Sources**: Pamela’s, Batumi, Stages for automation.
- **Filters/EQ**: Shape stereo field or automate filter sweeps (e.g., Ripples, Belgrad).
- **Effects**: Stereo reverb/delay (MIMEOPHON, FX Aid, Magneto) for space and atmosphere.
- **VCAs/Envelopes**: For level, panning, dynamic shape per part.
- **Performance Control**: Use MIDI controller + MIDI-to-CV or tactile modules (like Planar2) for live tweaking.

## 8. **Tips for Full-Length Song Structure**
- **Plan Sections**: Use mutes, modulation, and arrangement to move from “when everything is playing the same” to “clear changes between verse, chorus, breakdown, fills, and builds.”
- **Automate**: Don’t set & forget any sound—modulate and change parameters across the timeline.
- **Stereo Field**: Chainsaw excels here. Try mono for tight, stereo for “big” moments.
- **Layering**: Use Chainsaw for fills, pads, chords, and leads—even simultaneously—by exploiting its polyphonic CV inputs.

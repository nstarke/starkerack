# Using 2hp Switch for Full-Length Song Creation in Eurorack

The **2hp Switch** is a deceptively simple yet powerful voltage-controlled signal router for Eurorack modular synthesizers. Many modular musicians can easily patch up great grooves, melodies, or textures, but struggle with turning those into structured, evolving full-length tracks. This module can help "compose" with modular, providing control over structure, themes, and transitions—aspects typically handled by timeline-based DAWs.

Below are several creative techniques for using 2hp Switch, in combination with other modules, to assist in constructing full-length songs with movement, arrangement, and variation.

## 1. **Song Sections via Input Selection**

**What**: Feed four different sources into the four inputs of Switch: these could be full synth voices, different drum patterns, separate looped sequences, or even sections like intro/breakdown/drop/verse.

**How**:
- **Manually or via CV**, switch between these sources at appropriate moments, effectively "jumping" between song sections.
- Sequence the **SEL CV** input using a modulation source (e.g., LFO, envelope, or best—a sequencer synced to your main clock), programming when each section comes in.
- Useful for quickly auditioning song arrangements or performing live.

## 2. **Evolving Rhythmic or Melodic Patterns**

**What**: Route four variations of a pattern (drums, bass, melody, arpeggios), each slightly different, into Switch.

**How**:
- Use the Switch to cycle or switch between these variations, adding ongoing movement to a part that might otherwise get repetitive.
- You can automate the Switch through a sequencer or clock divider for predictable variation (for example, change every 8 bars), or use more random sources (S&H, random LFO) for generative changes.

## 3. **Dynamic Modulation Routing**

**What**: Use Switch to dynamically route different modulation sources (LFOs, envelopes, etc.) to a destination module (filter cutoff, oscillator FM, effect depth).

**How**:
- Change the modulation character throughout your song by switching what’s modulating a key parameter.
- For example, modulate filter cutoff with an envelope for a verse, a slow LFO for a chorus, and a sample-and-hold for a breakdown.
- SEL input or knob lets you "play" or automate these changes for expressive transitions.

---

## 4. **Audio "Splicing" and Layering**

**What**: Patch four different audio elements (melodic lines, atmospheres, noise, effects sends) into Switch’s inputs.

**How**:
- Sequence or manually switch between them to layer or alternate elements, creating breakdowns, builds, or surprise transitions.
- Combine this with external effects (reverb, delay) routed in and out for classic drop or climax moments.

---

## 5. **Performance & Live Improvisation**

**What**: Use the SEL knob as a hands-on performance tool.

**How**:
- Manually punch in fills, drops, or new themes during a live set by switching to new parts "on the fly."
- Or pre-program complex “arrangements” with your sequencer/CV source, but give yourself the freedom to override with the SEL knob for live improvisation during the performance.

## Pro-Tips and Combinations

- **Combine with Sequential Switches:** Use Switch together with other sequential selectors to build longer chains or more than four sections.
- **Link with Clock/Reset Sources:** Use clock dividers/multipliers or manual Gates to time changes with your song’s tempo and structure.
- **Envelope/VCAs:** Combine Switch's output with VCAs to fade changes in and out smoothly, rather than abrupt switching.
- **Preset Changes:** Prepare for live setlists or extended jams by routing whole preset “pages” (different voices, effects globals) through Switch.

## Summary

The **2hp Switch** serves as a versatile tool for macro-level control in modular—allowing you to step between song parts, alternate variations, or reshuffle modulation assignments dynamically. By incorporating the Switch into your workflow, and using it in conjunction with sequencers, modulation sources, and manual control, it's entirely possible to gain the type of song-based structure, evolution, and narrative that’s often missing from otherwise beautiful but static modular jams.

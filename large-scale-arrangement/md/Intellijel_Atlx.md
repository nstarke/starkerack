# Using the Atlx Expander for Full-Length Eurorack Songs

The **Atlx Expander** is a powerful add-on for the **Intellijel Atlantix**, providing 16 additional patch points for deeper self-patching and advanced routing, including dedicated waveform outputs (Osc A/B), multiple filter types, and a built-in ring modulator.

Creating a full-length modular song is an art that goes beyond building compelling sound patches—it's about arranging, evolving, and sculpting your sounds over time. Here’s how the Atlx can help you expand beyond short loops into structured, evolving compositions.

## 1. **Unlock Independent Layering and Automation**

The dedicated outputs (Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, Sub-square) for both oscillators allow you to:
- **Multitrack**: Send different waveforms to individual VCAs, effects, or mixers, so you can bring in and out voices (melody, bass, harmony) independently.
- **Automate Transitions**: Use CV-controlled VCAs or switches to fade layers in or out for intros, outros, and breakdowns.

### Example Patch:
- Send Sub Square from Osc A to a lowpass filter (for bass).
- Use Saw from Osc B for a higher melody.
- Route each into separate VCAs controlled by envelope generators or modulation sources like LFOs, sequencers, or function generators (Intellijel Quadrax, Maths, etc.).

## 2. **Filter Output Variety for Arrangement**

The Atlx gives you **lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and phazor** filter outputs.
- **Switch Sonic Roles**: Route melodies, basslines, or percussive elements to different filter outputs for sudden or gradual timbral shifts (e.g. moving a hat or snare from hi-fi to lo-fi).
- **Automated Morphing**: With a matrix mixer (e.g. Intellijel Triplatt) or CV switches, you can crossfade between different filter outputs for evolving textures.

### Example:
- During a build-up, slowly morph your main voice from lowpass to phazor output, increasing energy until the drop.

## 3. **Ring Modulator for Dynamic Transitions**

The built-in ring modulator (with X and Y ins & RING out) can:
- **Create Percussive Hits** during section changes.
- **Fade in Metallic/AM-rich Tones** for breakdowns.
- **Automate Modulation**: Use sequencer, envelope, or manual CV to rhythmically or dynamically engage the ring-mod sound.

## 4. **Self-Patching for Modulation and Evolution**

Use the additional waveform and filter outputs to create self-modulating, evolving patches:
- **Patch LFOs or Envelopes into Filter CVs, Oscillator FM, or VCA CVs**.
- **Sample & Hold from Filter Noise or Oscillator Sub-Square** to modulate other voices' pitch or timbre, creating organic, generative changes.

## 5. **Integration With Sequencers and Performance Controllers**

Pairing Atlx/Atlantix with sequencers (Intellijel Metropolix, Steppy) and performance controllers (Tetrapad, Planar2) allows:
- **Scene/State Changes:** Program CVs/gates to bring layers in/out, change filter types, and manipulate FX in song sections.
- **Manual Control:** Use a performance controller to fade, switch, or modulate parts in real time.

## 6. **Live Looping, Sampling, and Real-Time Performance**

With enough voices via the expander, send independent parts to loopers, samplers, or external effects for real-time arrangement. Layered processing and real-time interaction maintain movement and interest throughout your composition.

# **General Patch Ideas for Song Arrangement**

| Section Type   | Technique                                                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intro          | Start with filtered, evolving drone on bandpass/lowpass; slowly fade in melody |
| Verse          | Add rhythmic layer from oscillator square/sub; automate filter transitions      |
| Chorus         | Open up phazor/highpass, engage ring mod for bright hits/beats                 |
| Breakdown      | Mute melody, only filter noise or ring mod textures; heavy modulation          |
| Build-Up       | Crossfade filters, increase modulation speed, fade in ringmod                  |
| Drop/Climax    | Bring all voices together, full-frequency range, melody and bass prominent     |
| Outro          | Gradually remove layers using sequencer, filter out voices, fade sub           |

### **Tips for Full Song Creation**
- **Pre-plan Song Structure**: Assign different outputs to unique mixes/sends corresponding to song sections.
- **Use Automation**: Patch sequencer triggers/voltages to control VCA, filter CV, wave selects, mix levels.
- **Record and Overdub**: Use a DAW/interface to record multi-track layers, arrange, and overdub in post if required.

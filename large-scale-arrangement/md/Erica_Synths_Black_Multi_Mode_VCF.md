# Using The Erica Synths Black Multimode VCF In Full-Length Eurorack Songs

## Introduction

The **Erica Synths Black Multimode VCF** is a versatile voltage-controlled filter (VCF) module with simultaneous high-pass, band-pass, and low-pass outputs, CV control over both cutoff and resonance, and a built-in germanium diode input overdrive. While the VCF is often seen as a tone shaper, its feature set makes it especially useful for arrangement and song structure within a modular setup—precisely the challenge when building compelling, narrative songs beyond simple jams.

## Key Features for Songwriting

- **HP/BP/LP Simultaneous Outputs**: Parallel patching or switching for evolving textures.
- **CV Control of Cutoff & Resonance**: Automation and dynamic filtering essential for buildups and breakdowns.
- **Self-Oscillation**: Can be used as a bass, percussion, or melodic source.
- **Input Overdrive**: Adds character and punch to transitions or climaxes.
- **Attenuverters for CV Inputs**: Precise control over modulation depth.

## Strategies for Full-Length Song Arrangements

Below are approaches and patch ideas for using the Black Multimode VCF as a "song structure tool" in a Eurorack system:

### 1. **Dynamic Filtering for Verse/Chorus/Bridge Sections**
- **Automate Cutoff/Resonance**: Use sequencers, envelopes, LFOs, or even manual control via performance knobs to sweep filter cutoff/resonance at key sections (e.g., open up LPF for chorus, close for verse).
- **Scene Switching with Multiple Outputs**: Route LP, BP, and HP outputs to a mixer or switch to instantly change the band's frequency content for different sections (smooth pad in verse with LP, bright and cutting in chorus with BP or HP).

### 2. **Transitions, Builds, and Drops**
- **Resonance Sweeps**: Patch an envelope or function generator to the resonance CV. Use this to intensify climaxes or irradiate drops with aggressive resonance spikes.
- **Overdrive Circuit**: Increase input drive as you approach a drop, then pull it back for breakdowns for a dynamic timbral shift.

### 3. **CV-Controlled Movement**
- **Sequenced Modulation**: Use step sequencers or random sources to modulate cutoff/resonance per pattern or section, creating evolving filter movements that match song structure.
- **Macros and Hands-On Control**: Map attenuverters and knobs as performance macros for expressive, live arrangements—fade in HP while fading out LP, for example.

### 4. **Parallel & Layered Filtering**
- **Multitimbral Patching**: Send the same audio through all three outputs and process/filter them differently (e.g., LP to bass channel, BP for mids, HP for rhythmic/texture channel). Switch/mix between these as "instrument layers" in your song.
- **Crossfading Sections**: Use a crossfader module to morph smoothly between filter modes/output sections as your track progresses.

### 5. **Self-Oscillation as a Song Element**
- **Filtered Sine as Bass or Lead**: When the resonance is high, the filter self-oscillates. Use this as a sine wave for bass or melodic sections, then blend or replace with standard VCO(s) during other sections.
- **Transition FX/Noise**: Excite the VCF at high resonance with white noise or other sources and modulate cutoff for classic sweep FX, risers, or drops.

## Example Patch Concepts

### Example 1: Filter-Based Song Structure

- **Verse:** LPF cutoff low, resonance moderate. Dry, mellow sound.
- **Pre-Chorus:** Gradually automate the cutoff higher and increase drive, introducing more frequency components.
- **Chorus:** Switch to HP or BP output, open cutoff, and increase resonance for energy.
- **Breakdown:** Use self-oscillation for a filtered sine melodic solo or sweep resonance with white noise for dramatic FX.

### Example 2: Filter Layering For Texture Changes

- **Patch three separate voices to each filter output.**
    - **LP:** Bass.
    - **BP:** Mid-rich melodic layer.
    - **HP:** Percussive or noise-rich channel.
- **Switch or crossfade between these as verse/chorus/bridge sections, or blend all for climactic moments.**

## Recommended Module Pairings

- **Sequencer (for automation of CV inputs)**
- **LFO/Envelope Generators (for evolving or rhythmic filter modulations)**
- **VCA/Mixer (for output blending, crossfading, and volume automation)**
- **Switches/Sequential Switch (for instant sound variations/scene shifting)**
- **Noise Source (for percussive/FX excitement with self-oscillation)**

## Final Thoughts

The Erica Synths Black Multimode VCF is far more than just a tone shaper. Its multiple outputs, extensive CV routings, and overdrive add up to a powerful tool for sculpting dynamic, evolving full-length songs. By treating the filter as a structural instrument—shaping not just timbre but song form—you can elevate your arrangements beyond simple loops into full, expressive tracks.

# Using the BD808 to Create Full Length Songs in Eurorack

The Tiptop Audio BD808 is an analog kick drum module, an adaptation of the iconic Roland TR-808 bass drum for Eurorack systems. While it excels at classic, fat electronic kicks, its unique features and modular flexibility also make it a powerful tool for creating dynamic, evolving arrangements that are the backbone of full-length tracks.

Below is an analysis and some strategies for leveraging the BD808, in combination with other modules, to move from a simple groove to a structured, engaging song.

## Key Features to Leverage

- **Voltage-Controlled Accent & Level:** Adds dynamic contrast to patterns—crucial for rises, drops, choruses, and fills.
- **Enhanced Gain Stage:** Push the BD808 into overdriven, distorted realms or dial back for clean thump as song sections change.
- **Variable Decay & Tone:** Sweep decay and tone for evolving timbres, from tight punchy hits to subby drones or “basketball” style snap.

## Techniques for Song Creation

### 1. **Dynamic Variation With Accent & Level**

- **Automate Accent:** Patch a sequencer or random trigger source to the Accent In. Have strong accent hits on downbeats or transitions (e.g., the first kick after a break).
- **Use Accent for Section Contrast:** Create distinct sections by automating accent intensity—subtle kicks in verses, maximal accent in choruses or drops.

### 2. **Decay and Tone Modulation for Evolution**

- **Decay Automation:** Manually or with CV, fade the decay from short (for tight, intro beats) to long (for breakdowns or atmospheric bridges). Longer decay can melt the kick into a sub-bass texture.
- **Tone Sweeps:** Use the Tone control to move from dark, soft kicks to bright, snappy ones as energy builds.

### 3. **Processing for Variation**

- **Waveshapers & Distortion:** Increase BD808 level to drive the signal into a wavefolder or distortion module for new tonal flavor during intense moments.
- **Resonant Filtering:** Modulate a resonant low-pass filter post-BD808 for techno “thump” or break it open on transitions.

### 4. **Pattern Switching and Muting**

- **Multiple Rhythmic Variations:**
    - Sequence varying BD808 patterns using a trigger/gate sequencer or clock divider/multiplier.
    - Use a sequential switch or logic module to change rhythmic patterns for verse/chorus/bridge/outs.
- **Mute Automation:** Use a VCA to “mute” the BD808 in breakdowns or transitions, reintroducing it with accent for maximum impact.

### 5. **Percussive Layering and Cross-Modulation**

- **Layer With Other Drums:** Combine the BD808 with other drum modules (e.g., snare, hi-hat from HATS808). Use logic or trigger combiners for fills or layering effects.
- **Amplitude/Filter Modulation:** Use BD808’s envelope or output as CV source to modulate amplitude or filter cutoff on synth or noise modules, tying musical elements together.

### 6. **Creative Patch Ideas for Song Structure**

- **Kick as Sub-Bass:** With long decay and tone up, process the BD808 through pitch-shifting or wavefolder modules for basslines.
- **Gate BD808 Into FX for Drops:** Route the output through modules like delays, reverbs, or even granular/looper effects modules. Automate wet/dry with CV for dramatic transitions.
- **Trigger Pattern Probability:** Use trigger logic or probability modules to introduce “fills” or classic “mute” sections—the kick drops out, then punches back in.

## Example Song Structure Using BD808

1. **Intro:** Short decay, low accent. Filtered or processed for a subtle thump.
2. **Verse:** Tight rhythm, occasional accent for groove. Layer with hi-hats and claps.
3. **Pre-Chorus:** Increase accent and level. Modulate tone for brightness.
4. **Chorus/Drop:** Max accent, full level, longer decay. Add processing (distortion, delay).
5. **Bridge/Breakdown:** Mute or filter out BD808. Introduce effects (reverb freeze, echoed bursts).
6. **Final Chorus/Outro:** Bring back with accent and decay sweeps, maybe automate a pitch or tone drop on the fade.

## Key Takeaways

- **Treat the BD808 as an expressive instrument**, not just a static drum machine voice—modulate, process, and automate!
- **Songwriting in modular is about variation, contrast, and surprise**—use all the BD808’s features to create dynamic arcs.
- **Don’t be afraid to process and re-purpose**—let the BD808 become a sub bass, an effect, or a percussive texture.

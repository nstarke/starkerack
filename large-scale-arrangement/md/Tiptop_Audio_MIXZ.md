# Using the Tiptop Audio MIXZ for Full-Length Eurorack Songs

The Tiptop Audio MIXZ module is more than just a utility mixer—it's a tool that enables large-scale set arrangement and structure within a Eurorack system. Crafting a full song on modular not only involves making interesting sounds but also demands transitions, arrangement, and control. Here’s how to take advantage of MIXZ in a song-oriented workflow:

## **Key Features of the MIXZ in Song Building**

- **Dual 4-Channel Mixing**: Mixer A and Mixer B allow you to manage separate groups of sounds or signal paths, each with dedicated or summed outputs.
- **Master Gain & Individual Control**: Mixer A has per-channel gain, Mixer B has a master output control.
- **Tiptop Bus Mix Integration**: Mix drums or other sources from compatible modules via the bus board, freeing up front-panel patch points and enabling mass muting/enabling via jumpers and the module’s BUS toggle.
- **Low Noise Summing**: Clean mixing of audio, CV, and gates, important for layered arrangements and song clarity.

## **Techniques for Creating Full-Length Songs with MIXZ**

### **1. Song Sectioning Through Mixer Grouping**
- **Assign Sounds to Mixers**: Send separate voices (like drums, bass, leads, atmospheres) to different mixer sections.
    - **Example**: Drums via BUS Mix + Mixer B, melodic content via Mixer A.
- **Manual Transitions**: Use patch cable insertion/removal to reroute Mixer A out of Mixer B, effectively muting/introducing sections on the fly—a tactile way to handle verse/chorus/bridge changes.

### **2. Live Arrangement via Bus Mix**
- **Selective Drum Muting/Enabling**: With individual modules enabled/disabled on the bus, and the MIXZ BUS switch acting as a global mute, you can bring in or drop out complex percussion sections instantly—ideal for drops, builds, and breakdowns.
- **Performance Switch**: Flip the BUS switch for dramatic silences or re-entries in your song arrangement.

### **3. Layering and Spatial Movement**
- **Stereo/FX Sends**: Route Mixer B’s output to effects like delays, reverbs (e.g., Z-DSP in the manual’s example), and fade those effects in/out for dynamic intros, outros, and breakdowns.
- **Stacked Mixing**: Have Mixer A process your main harmonic content, route into a filter, then into Mixer B with drums. You can gradually build up your song by bringing in extra tracks via the unused channels in each mixer.

### **4. Scene Creation and Morphing**
- **Patch Automation**: Use voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs) or mutes post-MIXZ for automated volume fades or switching sections with external sequencers.
- **External Control**: Use a logic or trigger module to perform “scene” changes by switching which sound groups are routed to the output, or by automating the BUS on/off with external helpers (manual engagement will always be most direct).

### **5. Dynamic Song Progression**
- **Gradual Build-ups**: Slowly raise levels on Mixer A/B, or open the BUS, to create layered introductions.
- **Breakdowns**: Instantly cut sections by pulling a patch cable from Mixer A’s out (removing its sum from Mixer B), or flipping the BUS off.
- **Jams and Improvisation**: With 8+ channels + BUS, you can jam and improvise song structure, bringing in or dropping out voices as needed.

## **Workflow Example: Building a Modular Song**

1. **Intro:** Bus Mix and all channels off. Fade in atmospheric elements on Mixer A.
2. **Verse:** Bring in drums by flipping BUS switch; add bass via Mixer B.
3. **Chorus:** Patch in Mixer A to Mixer B, combine all voices and bring up FX sends for heightened energy.
4. **Breakdown:** Pull Mixer A out, flip BUS switch off—only atmospheric effects remain.
5. **Build:** Gradually raise levels, re-enable BUS, push signal back into Mixer B for the next section or a final drop.
6. **Outro:** Fade everything out using master gain on Mixer B, or manual level fades.

## **Pairings with Other Modules**

- **Drum Modules**: All Tiptop drum modules for easy BUS Mix workflow.
- **Sequencers**: For automating CV/gate changes to dynamics or voice selection.
- **VCAs & Mute Switches**: Post-MIXZ for more automated section changes.
- **Envelope Followers/Controllers**: To modulate levels on MIXZ for dynamic builds.
- **Effects (e.g., Z-DSP, Echo, Reverb)**: For spatial transitions and song development.

## **General Tips**

- Modular “songs” are about performative arrangement—use MIXZ as your central hub to introduce, remove, and blend elements in real time.
- Plan ahead: assign your song elements to different channels or BUS slots to facilitate quick changes on the fly.
- Practice transitions! The muscle memory of flipping BUS, patching, and fading will make your live modular songs engaging and cohesive.

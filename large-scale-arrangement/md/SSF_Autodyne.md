# Using the SSF Autodyne to Create Full-Length Songs in Eurorack

As a modular synthesizer musician, expanding your jams into complete, evolving tracks is challenging. The **SSF Autodyne**—a 4hp auto-compressor/distortion module—can help you add dynamic movement, glue, and intensity to your patches, making your arrangements feel like real, finished songs rather than loops. Below, I’ll break down how Autodyne’s features can be strategically combined with other modules to enable powerful, song-length workflows.

## Key Features to Harness

- **Auto-compression & Distortion:** Clean/character compression, high-grade distortion, or a blend.
- **Multi-mode Side Chain Filter:** Lets you focus compression on selected frequencies.
- **NY-Style Parallel Compression & Blend:** Mix dry and wet signals for punchy dynamics.
- **Switchable Side Chain Input:** External signal can control compression.
- **Single-Comp Control:** Ratio, threshold, and gain in one knob—sweep for subtle to extreme effects.

## Techniques for Song Structure and Dynamic Evolution

### 1. **Dynamic Arrangement With Compression Automation**

- **Patch Suggestion:** Run your full mix, beat, or melodic part through Autodyne.
- **Manual Tweaks:** During your performance, slowly sweep the COMP and GAIN controls to push your song from subtle, spacious sections into aggressive, saturated peaks—perfect for builds, drops, or breakdowns.
- **Result:** Your pieces breathe, swell, and recede like full-length electronic tracks.

### 2. **Side-Chain Compression for Movement**

- **Classic “Pumping” House Effect:** Patch your kick drum trigger or envelope into the Side Chain Input. This makes the compressor “duck” the rest of your mix every time the kick hits.
- **Evolving Mixes:** Vary which sound goes to the side-chain at different points—e.g., swap from the kick to a melody or CV-controlled gate to reinforce song sections (breakdowns, climaxes, outros).

### 3. **Frequency-Selective Transitions With Side Chain Filter**

- **Control Over What Triggers Compression:** Use the side chain filter to carve out lows during breakdowns, then let full-spectrum compression loose during drops for heightened impact.
- **Filtered Drops:** Sweep the side-chain filter to shift the weight of compression, making transitions between sections feel epic and intentional.

### 4. **Parallel Compression Blend for Textural Changes**

- **On-the-Fly Texture Morphing:** Slowly increase the BLEND knob during a build, mixing in dry signal for bright clarity, then push fully wet during climax for fat, squashed peaks.
- **Songwriting Angle:** Use the blend control live, or automate via CV mixers or hands, to give different sections unique energy profiles.

### 5. **Extreme Distortion for Song Climaxes or Interludes**

- **Creative Distortion:** Crank the GAIN for brutal, aggressive segments. Use as a one-shot FX moment or an ongoing noise/saturation layer in specific sections.
- **Variation:** Toggle between clean compression in verses and wild distortion in choruses/breaks.

### 6. **Stereo Processing for Width and Impact**

- **Matched Pair Mode:** Use two Autodynes on a stereo bus. Manually match controls for subtle to dramatic stereo compression/drive. Automate stereo field or switch from mono (tight intro) to wide (huge drop).

## Modular Combinations for Song-Length Patches

1. **Sequencers:** Trigger changes in side-chain input, modulation, or even switch which voices/buses go through Autodyne for arrangement changes.
2. **VCAs/Automated Mixers:** Crossfade between compressed and dry signals, or automate send/returns for different song sections.
3. **Switches/Sequential Switches:** Route different voices or FX returns through Autodyne at different points (e.g., intro dry, buildup compressed).
4. **CV Controllers:** Use LFOs, envelopes, or automation lanes (via MIDI-to-CV) to sweep COMP, GAIN, or BLEND over time, matching your song’s structure.
5. **Other FX:** Stack Autodyne after reverb or delay for classic “pumping FX” or before them to saturate and glue your source.

## Example Patch Flow (for a Full Song)

- **Intro:** Subtle Autodyne compression, filter side-chain to preserve lows.
- **Build:** Gradually increase COMP/GAIN, start blending in more compressed signal.
- **Drop:** Fully open COMP, engage external side-chain from kick, sweep side-chain HPF for extra punch. Push GAIN for saturation.
- **Breakdown:** Back off COMP/GAIN, bypass side-chain, blend in more dry signal.
- **Outro:** Reduce BLEND/COMP, fade out with delicate compression.

Automate or perform these moves for dynamic, evolving, song-length structures.

## Final Thoughts

While the SSF Autodyne is just one tool in your rack, its dynamic and flexible character controls give you critical performance-oriented levers for moving beyond static loops into expressive, arranged, and professional modular tracks. Combine it with creative patching, performance, and modular modulation for endless full-length music possibilities.

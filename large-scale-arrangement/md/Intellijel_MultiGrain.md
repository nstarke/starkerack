# Using Intellijel Multigrain v1.2 for Full Song Creation in Eurorack

Creating a full-length song in Eurorack is a challenge for many modular musicians. The Intellijel Multigrain v1.2—a Live Stereo Morphing Granular Sampler—offers a range of deep features specifically designed to take you from cool loops to structured, evolving works. By creatively patching Multigrain with sequencers, modulation sources, utilities, and effects, you can compose, structure, and perform entire tracks within a modular environment.

Below is an analysis and strategy guide for using Multigrain as the heart of your song-making process.

## Key Features for Song Creation

- **Eight Simultaneous “Sounds” (Samples or Live Audio):** Instantly switch between different sample sets, instruments, field recordings, or entire song sections.
- **Scenes & Morphing:** Each Sound has two savable states (A/B). Morph seamlessly between drastically different timbres and setups—ideal for song transitions, breakdowns, and builds.
- **CV Control Over Almost Every Parameter:** Everything from sample selection to scrub position, pitch, and reverb can be automated—perfect for evolving parts over a track’s length.
- **Live Sampling & Looping:** Capture, resample, or granulate external audio on the fly. The Live Input function can act as an audio looper or effects unit.
- **Presets, Projects & MicroSD Storage:** Recall complex setups, sections, or entire live sets instantly.
- **Internal Modulation and Randomization:** Create organic movement, generative structures, or repeatable morphs and fills.
- **Dedicated Outputs & Mod Outs (A/B):** Use Multigrain to send modulation, triggers, and envelopes to other modules.

## Strategies for Full Song Creation

### 1. **Modular Song Sections / Arrangement**

- **Load Different “Sections” Into Sounds:** Pre-load verse, chorus, bridge, outro riffs or even different sample palettes into the eight Sounds. Use the SELECT CV input and sequencers (e.g., 8-step sequencer, voltage block, or DAW-clocked CV) to automate song progression.
- **Granular Scene Morphing:** Use the Morph fader (and CV) to create transitions between A and B scenes for micro-evolutions within a section, or morph whole textures for breakdowns, build-ups, or drops.
- **Presets & Projects for Macro Structure:** Prepare different Presets for each “song” or main section, and trigger them with manual control or systematically with external triggers.

### 2. **Dynamic Granular Textures as Song Elements**

- **Granularize Drum Loops, Vocals, or Melodies:** Load stems or samples for melody, racks, or vocals and use granular controls (size, pitch, scan, wrap, etc.) to turn simple loops into continuously evolving material.
- **Live Sampling and Looping:** Sample your own performance, other module outputs, or even external musicians live. The Looping Recorder enables real-time texture capture for improvisation or “sampling yourself” for buildups, breakdowns, or outros.
- **Random & Modulating Parameters:** Assign internal random or external LFOs/envelopes to grain rate, size, pitch, or scene morphing, for evolving pads, glitchy breakdowns, or generative fills.

### 3. **Performance and Arrangement Control**

- **External Sequencers/Controllers:** Patch triggers/gates from modular sequencers or performance controllers to GATE/NEXT/SELECT inputs: automate switching between Sounds, or rhythmically trigger grains for fills and transitions.
- **Morph CV Automation:** Automate the Morph fader with an envelope, random source, clocked LFO, or DAW CV for “sweep” transitions.
- **Manual Performance:** Use the LATCH and Sound buttons for finger-drum style live triggering or sound selection during a performance.

### 4. **Song Evolution With Multigrain Mod Outputs**

- **A/B Assignable CV Outs:** Assign Morph position, triggers, envelopes, or random values to drive other modules (e.g., envelope for VCA, trigger for percussion). Synchronize non-sample-based voices, effects, or lighting to Multigrain’s performance.

### 5. **Mixing Granular & Conventional Synthesis**

- **Hybrid Patching:** Route Multigrain’s output through filters, VCAs, and effects for further processing. Feed its outputs into physical modeling, distortion, or time-based effects to add “live” morphing textures to otherwise static sequences.
- **Layer Multigrain With Analog/CV-Driven Voices:** Use Multigrain for the atmospheric, percussive, or abstract layers while a classic analog bass, lead, or drums provide stability and groove.

## Example Song-Flow Patch Ideas

| Section                | Sounds / Controls                                     | Eurorack Patch Suggestion                                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intro/Pad Fade In      | Sound 1 (Pad, slow grains), Scene A (static), B (motion) | Start Morph left, slowly fade to right with envelope/LFO.         |
| Verse / Texture        | Sound 2 (Looped texture), assign random to grain position | Use GATE/NEXT with sequencer for rhythmic triggers.               |
| Build / Transition     | Morph from A->B (Pitch up, rate increase, reverb build) | CV-Morph with envelope/lfo tied to manual performance or clocked event.  |
| Chorus / Main Groove   | Sound 3 (Chopped sample), use Rate/Size linking       | GATE input from drum machine to trigger slices; evolve tone via mod assignments. |
| Breakdown / Re-Sample  | Capture live input, assign to Sound 4, rapidly morph/granularize | Use Looping Recorder, modulate freeze with random or gestural CV. |
| Bridge / FX / Drop     | Sound 5, reverse grains, automate scan/wrap          | Random assignments for evolving, glitchy feel.                    |
| Outro                  | Morph all Sounds through Scenes, modulate Blur for fade | Assign external clock signal for scene fadeout synchrony.         |

## In Combination With Other Modules

- **Clock/Sequencer:** Structured switching of Sounds/Scenes via CV, aligned with your timeline/sections.
- **Voltage Memory or CV Preset Modules (e.g., Malekko Varigate, Make Noise Pressure Points):** Recall and automate song structures alongside Multigrain settings.
- **Performance Mixer:** Bring elements in and out; live-mix Multigrain with other voices.
- **Utility Modules:** Use attenuverters, logic, or sequential switches to modulate Multigrain in musically meaningful ways.
- **FX Units:** Post-process Multigrain with reverb, delay, or distortion to create huge soundscapes.
- **MIDI-to-CV Interface / DAW:** If performing hybrid or with a CV clock/MIDI timeline, sync the transitions within Multigrain to your computer or hardware song timelines.

## Additional Tips

- **Presets = Song States:** Use Preset Save/Load as your “scene recall”—do a “verse/chorus/preset” live.
- **Live Sampling = Song Evolution:** Use always-listening and loop capture for building new motifs in real time.
- **Macros:** Patch Morph CV and mod assignments to multiple “musical” controls; sweeping one macro can create entire song section transitions.
- **Manual Interventions:** Don’t be afraid to “play” the module—switching Scenes, triggering Latch, or even swapping samples mid-performance for new song directions.

# Using the 2hp EG Envelope Generator to Create Full-Length Eurorack Songs

Many modular synth users find it easy to patch up an inspiring loop, but extending those ideas into dynamic, structured, full-length songs is more challenging. The 2hp EG is a compact, flexible envelope generator with unique features for dynamic patching. Here's how you can leverage it creatively, in combination with other modules, to build evolving, musical compositions.

## Summary: What Makes the 2hp EG Special?

- **Ultra wide envelope times:** 3ms to 11 minutes per stage (attack/decay)
- **CV over attack & decay:** Lets you automate envelope shapes
- **Switchable linear/exponential response:** For precise or musical contour shaping
- **Built-in attenuator (AMP knob):** For scaling the envelope amount
- **Tiny size (2HP):** Slot anywhere in your rack for modulation

## Tips for Song-Creation with 2hp EG

### 1. **Song Structure with Evolving Envelopes**

- Use the orbital-long envelope times for slow builds and releases—set an attack or decay to several minutes to open up a filter or VCA slowly, creating natural intro, outro, or breakdown sections.
- Use external sequencers or clock dividers to send trigger/gate signals for section changes (e.g., changing from verse to chorus, breakdowns, etc.).

### 2. **Dynamic Transitions and Automation**

- Patch slow LFOs, random voltages, or scene-based sequencer lanes into the attack/decay CV inputs to morph envelope timing throughout your performance—making for less repetitive, more 'performed' modulations.
- Example: As a chorus approaches, use triggered CV to extend the decay for longer reverb tails or swelling sounds.

### 3. **Expressive Drum Variation**

- Use the EG as a snappy envelope for drum voices—triggered by rhythm sequencers. Vary the attack/decay CV for fills, accents, and humanizing drum envelopes.
- For breakdowns, increase the decay for ride cymbals or hats to wash out the groove, then snap it back for returns to the main beat.

### 4. **Animated Melodic Motifs**

- Patch the envelope to modulate a filter cutoff or oscillator level, changing contour per sequence step. CV control can swing the mood from staccato, plucked lines to smoothed, pad-like swells.
- Linear/expo toggle gives contrast between percussive (expo) and smoother (linear) phrasing.

### 5. **Manual or Automated "Morphing"**

- Switch envelope shapes (linear/expo) live, or send triggers/gates from performance-oriented controllers to the EG trigger input—using the AMP for smooth fade-ins/outs, or abrupt drops, ideal for live improvisation.

### 6. **Layered Patches & Scene Changes**

- Use multiple EGs (or mult triggered output) for complex, layered modulation across your system, all synced to master timing, or offset for polymetric feel.
- Sequence EG parameters alongside your main CV sequences for truly dynamic patches, moving easily between different energy sections in your song.

## Example Patch Ideas

| Role            | EG Use                                          | Companion Module          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Song intro/outro| Attack/Decay set super slow, fades in/out      | VCA, Filter, Reverb       |
| Chorus lift     | CV decay longer for reverb tail                | FX, VCA                   |
| Beat accent     | Snappy decay for snare; slow for cymbal        | Drum module, LPG, Reverb  |
| Bass morph      | Envelope to VCF, CV mod for accent/basslines   | Filter, Sequencer         |
| Melodic phrasing| CV shaping of envelope for note expressivity   | VCO, Quantizer, LFO       |

## Workflow Tips for Composing Songs with 2hp EG

- **Plan Sections**: Use envelope stage lengths and CV to denote verses, choruses, breakdowns, and transitions. Map your patch so rhythm, lead, FX, and dynamics shift across song sections.
- **Hands-on Control**: Put the AMP or CV ranges within reach for manual tweaks during performance or live takes.
- **Automation**: Pair with step sequencers, LFOs, or control modules to automate dynamic changes—think of each EG parameter as a macro for your sound.
- **Layer**: Use several EGs (or copies of the 2hp EG) for impact on multiple layers at once—e.g., bringing in FX, modulating VCA, and filter cutoff per section.

By using the 2hp EG's long timing, voltage control, and morphable contour **creatively in song construction**—rather than just set-and-forget transient shaping—you unlock a whole new level of patch-based composition. Every song section can have unique motion and energy, transforming your modular jams into actual finished tracks.

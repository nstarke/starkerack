# How to Use Bastl Cinnamon for Creating Full Length Eurorack Songs

Turning a handful of great loops and sounds into a full song is a core challenge of modular synth performance. The Bastl Cinnamon, as a **unique state-variable filter**, is far more than just a resonant "sweetener" for your patches. Here’s how you can use Cinnamon—when combined with other Eurorack modules—to create dynamic, narrative-rich full-length tracks:  

## 1. **Morphing Song Sections With Filtering**

**Concept:** Use Cinnamon’s filter type outputs (HP/BP/LP) to sculpt transitions between parts.

- **Build tension:** Slowly automate the filter cutoff (with LFOs, envelopes, or sequencer CV) to move from a bass-heavy intro (LP), to a vocal/lead-friendly bandpass section, to a bright, driving highpass for the breakdown.
- **Automation:** Use sequencer or automation modules (like Voltage Block, Zadar, or Pam’s New Workout) to modulate cutoff and resonance, creating evolving timbres over time.
- **Song Transitions:** Flip the Character switches or toggle the Drive for dramatic section changes (e.g., drop from clean LP intro to overdriven BP for chorus).

## 2. **Turn the Cinnamon Into a Song Element**

**Concept:** Use its self-oscillating capabilities as an **oscillator** for basslines or melodies.

- With high resonance it self-oscillates; patch the filter's LP out right into your mixer/fx to use as a sine wave oscillator—sequence cutoff with a 1V/oct pitch CV for precise melodies or basslines.
- **Change character:** Flip Character switches at different song sections for textural shifts, introducing movement and interest.

## 3. **Dynamic Groove Processing**

**Concept:** Use Cinnamon after drums or sequenced percussive lines.

- **Sidechain tricks:** Use envelope followers or comparators from a kick trigger to CV the cutoff, creating a dynamic “ducking” or pumping effect.
- **Live FX:** Use manual filter sweeps on percussive elements for transitions, breakdowns, and builds—pair with delay or reverb for further impact.

## 4. **Performance Macros for Structure**

**Concept:** Use CV presets, pressure pads (like Planar 2), or sequential switch modules to change filter settings, creating A/B/C song sections.

- Pre-patch different output types (HP/LP/BP) to a mixer and fade between them with VCAs or performance mixers for natural transitions.
- Use sequential switches or matrix mixers to route audio through Cinnamon only for specific sections, automating song progression.

## 5. **Expressive Filter as Lead Instrument**

**Concept:** Use Cinnamon’s filter resonance "shapes" as vocal lead or synth line, with manual or voltage-control over the Character switches (modifications via mechanical actuators or switch-based logic).

- Combine with touch controllers, gestural CV generators, or pressure-sensitive pads for live performance and expressive song storytelling.

## 6. **Create Variance & Development**

**Concept:** Throughout a song, change not just notes but timbre—slowly bring in Drive, increase Input gain, flip Character switches, automate cutoff sweep rate (e.g., from slow intro swells to rapid rhythmic gating in climax).

- **Resonance morphing:** Automate resonance for moments of intensity or build, allowing the filter to self-oscillate—then back down for the outro or breakdown.

## Best Practices—Modular Songwriting Tips

- **Plan structure:** Use a sequencer’s CV/gate tracks or a switch matrix to predictably modulate Cinnamon parameters at section changes—think in verse/chorus/bridge shapes.
- **Mix parallel paths:** LP/HP/BP outs can be simultaneously processed, sent to their own FX chains, panned, or remixed for wide, layered sections.
- **Soundsource replacement:** In minimalist patches, Cinnamon can replace oscillators for lean sections (self-oscillation), then return to filtering role for dense sections.

**Summary**:  
The Bastl Cinnamon is deeply modular-friendly: it’s not just a “set-and-forget” filter, but a multidimensional instrument and performance modulator. Use its sheer tonal range, its CV-addressable cutoff, resonance, drive, character switching, and triple outputs to shape entire song arrangements: from ambient intros, creeping breakdowns, dynamic climaxes, and impactful drops. Its power in the context of a thoughtful patch structure, and with modulation/sequencing, makes it ideal for full-song generative or performed music.

# Using the 2hp Delay in Full-Length Eurorack Songs

Transitioning from looping beats and appealing basslines to a cohesive, evolving full-length track in modular can be a challenge. The 2hp Delay, as described in the manual above, is a flexible delay processor with CV (control voltage) over all key parameters: delay time, feedback, and mix. This flexibility is helpful not just for sound design, but for structure, movement, and evolving arrangements within a modular song. Below are some ways you can incorporate this delay module to help shape and expand your tracks into fully realized pieces.

## Core Functions Recap

- **Delay Time (TIME):** From very short to nearly 2s, CV controllable.
- **Feedback (FDBK):** From subtle repeats to infinite looping, CV controllable.
- **Mix:** Blend dry/wet signals, CV controllable.

## Strategic Uses for Song Structure

### 1. Evolving Textures and Sections

**Automate Parameters with Sequencers or LFOs:**
- Send slow-moving LFOs or sequencer CVs into the TIME, FDBK, and MIX CV inputs.
- Example: Increase MIX and FDBK in breakdowns for atmospheric washes, then snap back to dry signal for drops or chorus sections.

### 2. Transitions & Builds

**Delay as a Transition Tool:**
- Gradually raise feedback and wet mix at song "breaks" to create decaying, smeared echoes or pseudo-reverb effects.
- Automate TIME for pitch-shifting or tape-speed effects between sections.

**Scene Changes with Delay:**
- Use a voltage offset or switch module to change TIME/MIX/FDBK presets instantly between "verse" and "chorus" song parts.

### 3. Creating Movement and Interest

**Stereo Movement:**
- If you have two delay modules or can mult the output, pan short and long delays left/right for evolving stereo fields.

**Rhythmic Delay:**
- Sync short delay times to clock multipliers/dividers so echo patterns complement your rhythm.

### 4. Generative & Textural Use

**Looping Ambient Beds:**
- With FDBK at or near maximum, the module can “freeze” or self-oscillate echoes. Use this for evolving foundations, drone backdrops, or to slowly layer sounds during long-form arrangements.

**Live Performance:**
- Manually tweak controls for real-time dub-style effects during improvisation, feeding sections in and out with MIX/FDBK.

### 5. Multitimbral & Dynamic Song Arrangements

**Parallel Processing:**
- Mult a melodic or rhythmic track, send one signal through Delay and one dry. Use VCAs/mixers to crossfade these sources over song sections.

**Trigger-Based Modulation:**
- Use envelopes or trigger-based stepped CV (e.g., from a gate sequencer) to bump FDBK/MIX, causing bursts of echo on particular measures or accents.

## Example Patch for a Full Track

1. **Drum Beat:** Sequenced as main groove.
2. **Bass Line:** Dry most of the time; send occasional fills through Delay with increased MIX and FDBK during drops.
3. **Lead/Melodic Voice:** Route through Delay. Automate TIME and FDBK for intro/outro and bridge sections.
4. **Atmospheric Pads:** Sample and hold or manual knob sweeps into all CV inputs create shifting, evolving textures.
5. **Master Section:** Fade FX return in and out with VCA for song structure—wet during breakdowns, dry for climax/groove.

## Tips for Song-Length Structure

- **Automate With Intent:** Plan CV automation as “arrangement lanes,” not just modulation.
- **Save "Infinity":** Reserve maximum feedback for climactic moments (breakdowns, buildups, outros).
- **Morph or Crossfade:** Use VCAs and mixers to seamlessly shift between wet/dry or layered voices.

## Conclusion

The 2hp Delay’s CV-controllability is not just for fun modulations, but becomes essential for real song-building within eurorack. Treat your delay parameters as compositional tools, not just effects. With creative CV routing, switching, and performance gestures, you’ll unlock a toolkit for evolving, dynamic modular songs.

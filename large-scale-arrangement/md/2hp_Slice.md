# How To Use the 2hp Slice To Create Full Length Songs in Eurorack

The **2hp Slice** isn’t just a glitch/beat repeat effect—it’s a dynamic performance and arrangement tool that transforms simple loops and patterns into ever-evolving full-length song structures. Here’s how you can integrate Slice with your modular system to achieve traditional and experimental song forms.

## Understanding Slice As a Performance Tool

Slice excels at beat repeats, glitching, fills, rhythmic breakdowns, and adding variation—essentials for moving beyond looping riffs and into song development.

**Key Features**:
- Audio-rate clocking for creative stuttering and granulation.
- Size control (and CV!) for variable repeat lengths (from 2 bars to sub-16th stutters).
- Gate/trigger input and manual triggering for hands-on (or sequenced) effect activation.
- Latching/momentary modes for performative or automatic usage.
- Triplet toggling for more groovy variations.

## Song Structure Techniques

### 1. **Adding Sections (Verses, Choruses, Breakdowns)**
  
- **Beat Repeats as Transitions:**  
  Use Slice to signal changes between sections. For example, feed your full drum/bass/melody mix through Slice and engage a 1-bar stutter every 8 or 16 bars for a "breakdown" or transition cue.
- **Build-Ups and Drops:**  
  Automate the Size CV with envelopes or LFOs to ramp from long repeats (building anticipation) down to very short (1/64 or faster for a snare roll effect), then disengage Slice for a "drop" into the next section.

### 2. **Fill Generation**

- **Scheduled Fills:**  
  Use a sequencer or clock-divided trigger to regularly activate the Trig Gate Input at the end of each 4 or 8-bar phrase, creating dynamic fills without manual intervention.
- **Randomized Fills:**  
  Pair with a random CV/gate source (like 2hp Rnd or Mutable Instruments Marbles) on Trig Gate and/or Size CV. This introduces surprise fills or glitch FX, making repeated patterns less predictable.

### 3. **Breaks and Variation**

- **Manual Punch-Ins:**  
  In latching mode, use the Trig Button as a real-time performance switch to momentarily glitch or repeat any sound/feed at creative moments. Do this to isolate vocals, drums, or even ambient textures.
- **Momentary Mode:**  
  For DJ-style "stutter" FX, set to momentary, and tap in live. Automate via CV or with foot controllers for hands-on sets.

### 4. **Layering and Sampling**

- **Capture Rearranged Loops:**  
  Use a sampler/looper (like 2hp Loop or Make Noise Morphagene) after Slice to “resample” your beat-repeated variations. Use these new samples as new sections or drop-ins throughout your song.
- **Glitched Melodies & Vocals:**  
  Insert melodic or vocal lines into Slice for unique stuttered, chopped, or triplet-glitched textures. Use modulation (from an LFO, sequencer, or manual CV) to beat-repeat only the last note of a phrase, creating musical "interruptions."

## Patch Ideas For Song-Level Composition

### **A. Traditional Song Structure With Drum Machine**
- Drum pattern to Slice.
- Use external sequencer to activate Slice for fills (1/8 note repeats at end of every 8 bars).
- Size CV modulated by an envelope for “risers.”
- Mix wet/dry post-Slice for subtlety.

### **B. Experimental Glitch Section**
- Mult a master clock to both Slice and your main clock source. Modulate Size with random/S&H CV for erratic, glitchy phrases.
- Switch triplet toggle to add math/probability to repeats.

### **C. Live Arrangement**
- Use the Trig Button for on-the-fly switch-ups.
- Sample output to a looper; switch between “straight” signal and “sliced” for contrasting sections.

## Pairing Modules

- **2hp Rnd**: For random triggers and unpredictable modulation of Size or Gate.
- **2hp Play/Sampler**: Chop & re-sequence sampled slices as new song sections.
- **2hp Loop**: Live loop resampled glitch repeats. Layer or reverse them in real time.
- **Performance Mixer**: Fade between “sliced” and non-sliced versions for dramatic section changes.

## General Tips
- **Automate engagement**: Use DAW MIDI-to-CV, or programmable clocks/sequencers, to handle complex on/off routines for Slice (such as only activating on chorus entry).
- **Record everything**: Route Slice output to a DAW/recorder while improvising—cut/paste the best “moments” into your tracks.
- **Modulate parameters**: Don’t leave Size or Triplet switches static—use modulation for evolving, “alive” effects.

By leveraging **2hp Slice** as a live and automated trigger/resample tool, you unlock the ability to move beyond repetitive phrases and introduce real drama, variation, and narrative to your tracks.

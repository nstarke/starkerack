## Using the Access Virus TI Snow in Eurorack Song Composition

### Introduction

The [Access Virus TI Snow](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0897/6874/files/Virus-TI-Snow-Quickstart.pdf?17142989922564694832) is not a native Eurorack module, but as a desktop synthesizer with multi-part, deep synthesis, multi-mode, and advanced modulations, it can be a powerful voice, sequencer target, and multi-timbral workstation in a Eurorack-centric studio. The key creative challenge in modular is evolving past the loop: how do you progress from an awesome groove or synth line into a full track with movement, structure, and narrative?

Below is a modular-oriented analysis guiding how the Virus TI Snow can be a central tool in building full-length songs in conjunction with your Eurorack system.

### Leveraging Virus TI Snow Features for Song Structure

#### **1. Multitimbrality for Section Development**
- **Multi-Mode:** TI Snow is 4-part multi-timbral. Use this like 4 distinct eurorack voice chains.
    - **Example:** Assign Part 1 = Bass, Part 2 = Chord Stabs, Part 3 = Lead, Part 4 = FX/Pad.
- **Arrangement Tip:** Muting, unmuting, or fading these parts in and out creates verse/chorus/bridge structures.
    - **Implementation:** Use your Eurorack sequencer or MIDI controller to switch MIDI channels/parts dynamically, change note patterns, or sequence mutes with MIDI CCs.

#### **2. Dynamic Sound Design for Evolution**
- **Morphing Sounds:** Use patch parameters and modulations to evolve a patch over time. For example, start with low cutoff, add resonance, engage distortion, or morph wavetables across a track.
    - **External Control:** Use Eurorack MIDI-to-CV (like Mutable Yarns, Endorphin.es Shuttle Control) to send LFOs, envelopes, or random step CVs to Virus via MIDI CC assignments—slowly modulate parameters for evolving pads, morphing leads, and filter sweeps across your track.

#### **3. MIDI Integration & Sequencing**
- **Pair With Eurorack Sequencer:** Use a complex sequencer like Winter Modular Eloquencer or Five12 Vector to send up to 4 channels of MIDI to the TI Snow. Compose melodic, bass, and percussion lines separately, arrange song sections, mutes, fills, and transitions.
- **Clock Sync:** Sync Virus arpeggiator, LFOs, delays, and other tempo-based effects with your modular clock (send MIDI clock from Pamela’s New Workout, Hermod, etc.).
    - **Composition Technique:** Program automation and pattern changes in your modular sequencer for evolving song structures.

#### **4. Audio Input/Output as Hybrid Processing**
- **Audio Processing:** Send Eurorack voices or drums into the Virus audio inputs for effects, filtering, or even granular/timbre-fx resampling, then bring them back into your modular.
- **Thru Processing:** Use CONFIG/Input Thru for hands-on routing, or automate signal blend/motion for breakdown and build-up effects (e.g., fade a modular drum through Virus’ filter in a bridge section).

#### **5. Multi-Layered Performance & Automation**
- **Patch Recall & Morphing:** TI Snow supports total recall—save different snapshots for intro/verse/chorus/bridge, and switch them manually or via program changes as the “song” progresses.
- **MIDI Automation:** Sequence/automate filter, reverb, delay, pitch, or LFO amount for each part via CCs using your modular MIDI tools.

### Techniques to Break Out of the Loop

#### **A. Build Sections via Multi-Parts**
Each multi part is effectively a musical layer or a "scene." Arrange them across the song timeline for:
- **Intro:** Pads and FX only (Part 4).
- **Verse:** Add Bass (Part 1), minimal lead.
- **Chorus:** Full multi-part stack.
- **Bridge/Breakdown:** Solo FX, filter sweeps, arpeggiator pattern changes.

#### **B. Automation/Parameter Locking**
- From your modular system, sequence note/CC changes (with MIDI-to-CV) to open up Virus parameters for rises, drops, and evolving movement in the track.
- Use LFOs (internal or external) to modulate Virus’ parameters in time with modular events.

#### **C. Hybrid Audio Feedback Loops**
- Create feedback loops: modular audio → Virus input → Virus processed output → modular FX → recombine. Automate how much of this chain is heard at different song sections.

#### **D. Live Arrangement Tricks**
- Finger drum Virus’ multi-parts with a MIDI pad controller sequenced by your modular clock.
- Use touch controller (e.g. Intellijel Tetrapad, Make Noise Pressure Points via MIDI-CV) for expressive, live filter/effect/part switching.

### Example Full-Length Song Roadmap

1. **Start**: Pads/arps from Virus, evolving via internal LFOs, minimal modular drums.
2. **Verse**: Add bass from TI Snow (Part 1), trigger modular percussion.
3. **Chorus**: Stack all 4 parts, engage Virus internal effects, modular synth stabs join in.
4. **Bridge**: Modular elements route through Virus for heavy effect washes; Virus voice patches morph dramatically or drop to filtered sound.
5. **Breakdown**: Strip to lead and pad; automate Virus parameters for tension.
6. **Final Chorus/Climax**: All parts return, all Virus parts/parameters at their most open/bright settings.

### Other Modules For Deep Integration

- **Sequencers:** Five12 Vector, Squarp Hermod, Eloquencer (for tightly controlled MIDI song structuring)
- **MIDI-CV Utilities:** Mutable Yarns, Endorphin.es Shuttle Control, Polyend Poly 2
- **CV Source:** For parameter automation—Pamela’s New Workout, Make Noise Maths (via MIDI-CV mapping)
- **Switches/Mutes:** Mutable Branches, Doepfer A-150 for manual/triggered audio/MIDI routing changes

## Conclusion

The Virus TI Snow, especially in multi-timbral, sequenced, and MIDI-automated configurations, solves the single-loop "problem" by enabling evolution, progression, layering, modulation, and recall across a song. Treat each multi-part as a voice in your arrangement, sequence and process it via your modular, and leverage real-time or automated changes to bring new energy and form to your tracks.

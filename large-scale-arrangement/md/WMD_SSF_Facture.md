# Using WMD Fracture to Build Full Length Eurorack Songs

The WMD Fracture is not just a specialized drum module—it’s a multi-particle/texture percussion synthesizer that brings advanced, pseudo-random sample granulation into your rack. This means it excels not only at claps and applause, but also as a flexible source of transient textures, percussive detail, and organic noise floors. Here’s how to go beyond simple beats and leverage Fracture (and your other modules) to create dynamic, varied, full-length compositions:

---

## Key Concepts from the Manual

- **Granular, Pseudo-Random Engine**: You get evolving textures, never-quite-identical repetitions, and the ability to “seed” the randomness with CV.
- **Trigger, Accent, Tick Inputs**: Fine control of rhythmic detail and articulation.
- **Parameter Modulation (Density, Surface, Decay, Tail, Freq, Spread, Punch, Reverb)**: CV-addressable for evolving or automated movement in your song structure.
- **True Stereo Out**: Spatial possibilities.

---

## Songwriting & Arrangement Strategies

### 1. **Sectional Variation via CV Modulation**
- **Assign LFOs, envelopes, or sequencer lanes** to Decay, Surface, Density, or Tail. This lets you smoothly transition from tight, punchy “intro” sections to big, washy “chorus” textures.
- **Automate Surface switching** via slow CV to morph between different sound palettes for verse/chorus/bridge changes.

### 2. **Dynamic Percussive Textures**
- Don’t think only of claps—use Fracture as a source of syncopated ticks, crowd noise, granular shakers, or digital “ghost notes.”
- Use **Tick input** for single, micro-articulated events—fill gaps, accent offbeats, or create fills.

### 3. **Live “Jamming” Arrangement**
- Switch TAIL modes on-the-fly (via manual control or CV switching using a sequential switch/foot pedal) to quickly reshape percussive density between minimal, punchy, and splashy.
- Use an **external fader controller (like Frap Tools FALISTRI or Planar 2)** to manually perform Decay, Spread, and Punch during a song.

### 4. **Texture and Ambience**
- Run Fracture’s stereo out through modular or external **reverb, delay, or spatial FX** for ambient transitions, breakdowns, or imaginary audience sounds.
- Modulate Reverb setting with gate/envelope to crank up “roominess” during choruses or big finale moments.

### 5. **Structured Song Sections via Sequencing**
- Use a **Eurorack sequencer or CV preset manager** (like Hermod, Nerdseq, or Voltage Block) to store/recall specific modulation routings and parameter scenes for each part of a song.
- Change trigger patterns and accents over time, creating builds, tension, and release.

### 6. **Rhythmic & Timbral Layering**
- Parallel Fracture with classic drum modules—blend the synthetic/acoustic clap textures with matchy snare beats, rimshots, or hats for a hybrid groove.
- **Layer multiple Fractures (or use a switch/router)**: Alternate between drastically different Surface/pitch/tail settings for call-and-response percussion.

### 7. **Morphing Fills and Drop-Ins**
- During transitions, use **Density automation** (controlled via stepped LFO or envelope) to create fills, rushes, or “reverse applause” swells reminiscent of dance fills or breakdowns.

## Example Workflow

1. **Intro:**  
   - Sparse, grainy ticks using low Density, short Decay, dry Reverb, and minimal Surface choices.
2. **Verse:**  
   - Increase Density, modulate Spread for stereo width, use random CV into Surface to slowly shift timbre.
3. **Chorus:**  
   - Slam up Decay and/or enable more diffuse TAIL mode, max out Reverb, automate FREQ/SPREAD with an LFO for wide, lush, noisy crowd effects.
4. **Breakdown:**  
   - Reduce Density, lock Surface to percussive ticks or unusual transient samples, automate Reverb for a spacey fade.
5. **Drop/Fill:**  
   - Burst Density up via triggered envelope, sweep Surface, let envelope modulate Decay for a rolling fill.
6. **Outro:**  
   - Fade to sparse, random grain clicks—adjust TAIL and Density down, let Reverb tail off.

## Integrating with Other Modules

- **Sequencer/Scene Manager:** Automate parameter change for each song section.
- **LFO/Envelope/Random:** Animate Density, Decay, Spread, Freq for living textures.
- **Switch Matrix:** Rapidly shift CV routings or Surface selections for “scene change” effect.
- **Clock Divider/Logic:** Complex rhythms driving TRIG/TICK.
- **Mixer/Effect Bus:** Wet/dry blends for arrangement focus.

## Conclusion

The WMD Fracture is ideally suited to layered, narrative eurorack compositions. Its granular approach means no two fills or bursts have to be the same—combine this with thoughtful modulation and sequencing and you unlock a powerful vehicle for moving beyond the 16-step beat-loop trap into the domain of actual **songwriting and performance** within your modular system.

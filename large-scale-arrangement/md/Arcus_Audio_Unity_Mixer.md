## How to Use the Arcus Audio UNITY MIXER for Creating Full-Length Eurorack Songs

As a eurorack musician, creating a cohesive, full-length song is often more challenging than generating a single groove or melodic phrase. The Arcus Audio Unity Mixer, while seemingly simple, can be a powerful tool in facilitating song structure, transitions, layering, and sonic development throughout an extended performance or recorded piece. Below, I'll provide practical and creative ways to integrate this module into a workflow for building longer tracks.

### Key Features at a Glance

- 2HP width, compact format
- Dual 3:1 unity gain summing mixer (or single 6:1 if used as one)
- Bi-color LEDs for visual signal/polarity feedback
- DC-coupled: works for audio and CV
- High input impedance (10kΩ)

## Strategies for Creating Full-Length Songs with the UNITY MIXER

### 1. **Transitioning Between Sections/Scenes**

Use the mixer to sum multiple audio voices, CV patterns, or both. For instance:
- **Layered Sources**: patch several drum or melodic sources into one mix channel, and others into the second. Use mutes, VCAs, or sequential switches upstream to activate/deactivate groups of sounds, letting you orchestrate transitions smoothly from verse to chorus, breakdown, etc.
- **Scene Morphing**: Run differing rhythmic or tonal subsets into each mixer bus, and crossfade or switch which group is routed to your main output (with an external VCA or mute module) during live performance.

### 2. **Building Dynamic Arrangements via Submixes**

- **Audio Summing**: Group related sounds (e.g., all percussive elements or all melodic synths) with the mixer, and then process the summed mix with effects, filters, or VCAs for global control, making it easier to drop out whole groups at key song moments.
- **CV Mixing for Macro Control**: Use the mixer to combine modulation sources (LFOs, envelopes, manual offsets), sending the composite CV to affect a filter cutoff, oscillator pitch, or effects parameter. By changing which CVs are active via upstream attenuators or switches, you can alter multiple aspects of your sound for different song sections.

### 3. **Automating Builds, Drops, and “Growth”**

- **Performance Automation**: You can combine CV automation (generated by sequencers or LFOs) for effects like reverb send, global pitch, or timbral changes. For instance, ramp two envelopes with long attack into a single parameter, routed via the UNITY MIXER, to automate smooth ramps leading into a drop or new section.
- **Live Layering**: Stack multiple live or sequenced sources into the mixer, unmuting or patching in new voices during performance to add excitement and development, then muting or pulling them for breakdowns.

### 4. **Quickly Recombining Sources for Variation**

- **Song Variation**: Use the UNITY MIXER to re-route sources on the fly: e.g., 3 drum sources in one group, and 3 in another, then swap which group hits the main mix, or mix them all together in a “chorus” moment for larger impact.
- **MIDI/Non-modular Sources**: Use the two mixer buses to blend modular and non-modular sounds (if levels are correct), facilitating hybrid sets.

## Example Song Structure Workflow

**Intro**
- Subtle drones and noise textures mixed and slowly faded in via the UNITY MIXER.
- Combined CV from two LFOs summed to gently open up a reverb wet/dry on a send bus.

**Verse**
- Drum patterns from three sources mixed together, vocals/bass on another, using the bi-color LEDs for level/polarity feedback.
- Mute or pull sources from the mix for breakdowns/buildups.

**Chorus**
- Combine all six voices into a single mix using the 6:1 mode for a “full” chorus section.
- Use CV mixing to introduce dramatic modulation (filter sweeps, effects automation).

**Breakdown**
- Remove main drums or melody group from the mixer (quick patch change or upstream VCA mute).
- Use the Unity Mixer’s summed output to feed a granular or delay effect, building tension for the final drop.

**Outro**
- Gradually subtract sources from the Unity Mixer’s inputs, fading the track into ambience.

## Tips for Flexibility

- **Visual Feedback**: Use the LEDs to ensure phase/polarity is healthy during layering (prevents phase cancellation).
- **Expandable**: Chain the Unity Mixer with other mixers, switches, or matrix modules to scale up as needed.
- **Control Voltage Composites**: Try blending several modulation sources and sending the sum to effect modules, filters, or VCAs for “macro” movement in your song.

Growing your rack with multiple mixers such as the Unity Mixer lets you control arrangement, sections, and dramatic structure from within the patch, bridging the gap between abstract generative systems and traditional song forms.

## Quickstart Overview

The Ornament &amp; Crime (&quot;o_C&quot;) is a multifunction eurorack module. It offers multiple &quot;apps&quot; (programs) for pitch quantizing, sequencing, modulation, random/chaotic CV generation, envelopes, utilities, and much more. Apps are changed on-the-fly.

- **4 CV inputs (CV1–CV4):** ±10V (recommended ±5V typical), 12-bit ADC precision (below 0V may not be usable for all apps)
- **4 Trigger/gate inputs (TR1–TR4):** 0–5V triggers/gates/high=logic 1
- **4 Outputs (A–D):** -3V to +6V range, 16-bit DAC precision

## Panel &amp; Controls

### Encoders
- **Left Encoder**: 
    - App-specific (often: channel select, note select, root note, frequency),
    - In scale/sequence editors: move cursor/select item
    - Press: select/apply, activate, toggle scale, channel, or feature (depends on app)
    - Long Press: app-specific reset, copy, or clear, or enter alternate modes

- **Right Encoder**:
    - Scroll menus/settings, adjust values (in edit mode)
    - Press: Toggles selection vs. value edit mode
    - Long Press: Enter app selection menu (from anywhere)

### Buttons
- **Up Button**:
    - App-specific, often transpose/octave up, next slot, or increment values
    - Long Press: Enter screensaver from any mode

- **Down Button**:
    - App-specific, often transpose/octave down, previous slot, or freeze/buffer
    - Long Press: Reset scale/chord mask, alternate behaviors

### Display
- **OLED Display (128x64)**: Text and graphics for menu navigation, editing, and visual feedback.

## Navigation &amp; App Management

- **Startup:**
    - Hold **Left Encoder**: Enter calibration
    - Hold **Right Encoder**: App selection menu
    - **Normal boot**: Last saved app

- **App Selection:** Long-press Right Encoder anytime; turn to select; press to enter app.

- **Saving**: In app select menu, long-press Right Encoder to save all app settings and boot state (writes to EEPROM).

- **Reset to Defaults:** Hold both Up + Down buttons during startup splash screen.

- **Left Encoder (press):** Select/activate/channel toggle
- **Left Encoder (long):** App-defined, often reset/clear/copy (see app)
- **Right Encoder (turn):** Menu param navigation or value change/edit
- **Right Encoder (press):** Toggle navigation/edit mode, or enter/exit editors
- **Right Encoder (long):** Enter app menu

- **Down (press):** Transpose/octave down, prev (slot/sequence)
- **Up (long):** Screensaver (graphic feedback)
- **Down (long):** Reset scale/chord mask (in editors), app-dependent alt

---

## Voltage Ranges

- **Inputs (CV):** ±10V. Most useful musical range: ±5V.
- **Inputs (Trigger):** Threshold ≈ 1.5V, accepts typical 5V gates.
- **Outputs (CV):** -3V to +6V (not symmetric bipolar; level-shifter suggested for true bipolar LFOs).

---

## Special Notes

- **All inputs and outputs are re-mapped per app and often per channel. Consult app-specific mapping in manual for deeper routing.**
- **All settings are saved together via app menu &gt; long Right Encoder press.**
- **Scaling, quantization, and tuning options abound (microtonal, Bohlen-Pierce, user-tuning, etc).**
- **DAC update rate ≈ 16.7 kHz. Minor audible aliasing can occur for audio applications.**
- **OLED and DAC share data bus: audio quality not primary use-case.**

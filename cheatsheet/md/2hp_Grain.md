## **Control & CV Details**

- **DENS (Density) Knob:**  
  - Left: Periodic grains, speed increases leftward.  
  - Center: No grains generated.  
  - Right: Stochastic grains, speed increases rightward.  
  - **Also affected by FREQ control.**

- **DENS CV:**  
  - Controls granulization rate/position.  
  - **Range:** -5V to +5V

- **MIX Knob:**  
  - Left: 100% Dry (input),  
  - Right: 100% Wet (granular),  
  - Continuously blends.

- **MIX CV:**  
  - Controls mix between input and granular output.  
  - **Range:** -5V to +5V

- **V/OCT:**  
  - 1V/oct tracking for grains' pitch.  
  - **Range:** -1.5V to +5.5V

- **FREQ (Knob):**  
  - Left: Pitch shifted down 4 octaves  
  - Center: No pitch shift  
  - Right: Pitch shifted up 4 octaves  
  - **Also affects grain size and generation speed: higher = smaller/faster grains**

## **Quick Start Patch**
1. Patch audio source to **IN**.
2. Patch **OUT** to mixer/output.
3. Set **MIX** (knob) center for equal blend; left for dry, right for granular.
4. Use **DENS** to set grain activity.
5. Tweak **FREQ** (and optionally sequence with **V/OCT**) for pitch and grain character.
6. Animate parameters with CV sources for evolving textures.

## **Specs**

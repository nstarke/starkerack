# 7Path – Ethernet Patch Cable Bridge  
**Cheat Sheet**

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Connects two Eurorack cases (or two points in a large system) using a single Ethernet cable instead of long patch cables.
- **Type**: Passive signal bridge—no power required.
- **Form Factor**: 4HP wide, 3U tall, 20mm deep.

## How to Use

1. **Install** both 7Path modules in your cases or at desired locations.
2. **Connect** the two modules using a standard Ethernet cable (CAT5/6). *Does not include cable by default.*
   - *Supports up to 10 ft with unshielded, longer with shielded cables.*
3. **Patch** regular 3.5mm patch cables from your modules to any of the 7 jacks on the first 7Path.
4. **Retrieve** the signals on corresponding numbered jacks on the other 7Path module (1:1 pin mapping).

*Example: If you patch into jack #4 in case A, the corresponding jack #4 on case B outputs/receives the same signal.*

## Jack/Control Reference

| Jack          | Description                                    | Voltage Range         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1–7 (per module) | Bi-directional buffered (no restriction: can be input or output) | No stated voltage restrictions; supports any Eurorack signal type (typically ±12V, ±5V CV, gate, audio)* |

- **No knobs, buttons, sliders, or toggle controls.**
- **Completely passive:** No voltage/current manipulation; it simply connects signals directly.

\* While specific voltage ranges are not stated in the manual, standard Eurorack ±12V and audio CV/Gate are supported.

---

## Quick Reference
- **Connection:** Patch IN/OUT to jacks 1–7 on either module; corresponding jack on other module mirrors the connection.
- **No power needed** (passive).
- **For longer cable runs, use shielded Ethernet.**
- **Modules are interchangeable—no “send/receive” side.**

# **WMD Chimera — Cheat Sheet**

**Metallic Percussion Synthesizer | Eurorack Module**

---

## **Panel Controls & Knobs**

| Control    | Function  | Notes/Range |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **DENSITY**    | Number of grains in the sample window. | Low = slow timbral shifts, High = shimmery, ephemeral bursts. |
| **SURFACE**    | Morphs between 11 distinct impact surface types. | Captured textures from various real objects. |
| **DECAY**      | Controls decay time of sounds. | Short = ticks, Long = washed hits. |
| **FEEL**       | Selects between 3 rhythmic amplitude/volume patterns (see below). | Button toggles mode. |
| **(Pitch) ENVELOPE** | Amount of pitch up/down sweep with each note. | Negative = Doppler effect, Positive = Lazer zap. |
| **PITCH**      | Shifts overall pitch (frequency) of metallic texture. | ~5 octave range. |
| **FX**         | Select between: Bit Quality ↓ ( ), Sample Rate ↓ ( ), Comb Filter ( ) | Toggle. |
| **FX AMT**     | Adjusts depth of selected effect/type. | - |
| **OUT**        | Main audio output. | Patch to mixer or output module. |
| **TRIG button**| Manual trigger when pressed. | Use for manual hits/testing. |

## **Feel Modes (Rhythmic Patterns):**
1. **Mode 1:** All notes equal amplitude—good for consistent hits.
2. **Mode 2:** Four-step groove: Normal > Soft > Random > Soft. Added "shaking" from varied attack.
3. **Mode 3:** Randomized—each strike unique. With max decay, sounds blend and layer.

## **Input/Output Jack Summary**

| Jack   | Type      | Function        | Voltage Range  |
|--------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **TRIG**     | Input    | Triggers the sound. | +5V expected for gate/trigger. |
| **ACCENT**   | Input    | Accentuates hit and resets FEEL rhythm. | Typically 0–5V. |
| **CHOKE**    | Input    | Cuts length/amplitude short (mute/stop sound). | 0–5V gates. |
| **VCA**      | Input    | Voltage Controlled Amplitude, master volume. | 0–5V. |
| **OUT**      | Output   | Main synthesized audio output. | Modular audio, ±5V or ±10V typical. |

## **Modulation / CV Ins:**

- **Most major controls (Density, Surface, Decay, Envelope, Pitch, FX Amt) appear to be CV-able (refer to module for jack locations and labeled CV ins).**
- **Typical CV range**: 0–5V, unless marked otherwise. Use attenuators for fine-tuning.
- **VCA input**: Direct voltage control over output amplitude; unaffected by Decay setting.

---

## **Performance Tips:**

- Use **low Density** for evolving, spacious metallic textures; **high Density** for hi-hat, shaker, and noise-burst effects.
- Sweep **Surface** for timbral variety per hit—simulate drums, bells, and abstract percs.
- Use **Decay** to dial from tight, ticked percussion to swirling, cloud-like shimmers.
- Explore **Feel** modes with sequenced triggers to introduce rhythmic interest or randomization.
- **Pitch Envelope** makes for riser/fallers and wild sci-fi percussion.
- **FX** section adds digital or comb character—dial up FX Amt for crush, ring, or shimmer.

## **Patch Example:**
- **TRIG**: from your sequencer or clock source
- **ACCENT**: tie to sequencer accent outputs for dynamic grooves
- **CHOKE**: patch envelope or mute triggers to kill tails (e.g., open hats)
- **VCA**: modulate with LFO or envelope for dynamic volume control

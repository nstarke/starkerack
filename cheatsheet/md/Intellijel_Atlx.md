# **Intellijel Atlx (Atlantix Expander) Cheat Sheet**

A quick reference for using the Atlx expander with the Atlantix synthesizer voice.

---

## **Overview**
The Atlx is an expander for the Intellijel Atlantix. It provides **16 additional jacks**, focusing on more oscillator and filter outputs, plus an analog ring modulator section. **No additional power is required (passive).**

## **Controls on Atlx**
**Atlx is strictly an expander: it does not feature its own knobs, switches, buttons, or sliders.**  
All controls are on the main Atlantix module.

---

## **Main Atlantix Controls (for context)**
See the [Atlantix Manual PDF](https://intellijel.com/downloads/manuals/atlantix/Atlantix-Manual.pdf) for full details.

- **Knobs & Sliders:** Pitch, waveform mix/blend, filter cutoff/resonance, envelope controls, drive, etc.
- **Toggles:** Routing and range switches
- **Voltage Ranges for Modulation Inputs:** Typically ±5V or 0–8V normalized per Eurorack standards.
- **Audio Outputs:** Typically ±5V to ±10V swing

---

## **Usage Tips**
- Use **Atlx outputs** for advanced self-patching, FM, AM, alternative filter routings, and to interface with other modules.
- **Ring Mod** is great for clangorous metallic or bell-like tones—patch any two signals to X In and Y In.
- **Filter outs** allow extraction of simultaneously available filter types.
- **Oscillator outs** allow external mixing, waveshaping, or dedicated FM/AM patching not possible from the main Atlantix panel.

---

## **Physical Specs**
- **Width:** 6HP
- **Depth:** 22mm
- **Power:** Passive (no extra power needed)

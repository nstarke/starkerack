## Controls & Functions

### **Knobs**
- **VOICES**
  - Sets number of active oscillators.
  - CCW (counterclockwise) = 1 oscillator.
  - Center = 20 oscillators.
  - CW (clockwise) = up to 88 (Saw) / 55 (Pulse).

- **DETUNE**
  - Controls detune amount applied to oscillators.
  - CCW = No detune; Center = "tasteful" detune; CW = "chaotic" detune.

- **FREQ**
  - Macro pitch for all voices, tracks 1V/Oct.

### **Switches/Toggles**
- **WAVE TOGGLE**
  - Left: Sawtooth waveform.
  - Right: Pulse waveform.

## Patch Suggestions

- **Analog VCA:** Use with VCA for precise control over amplitude and modulation.
- **EG (Envelope Generator):** Shape the amplitude with snappy or drawn-out envelopes for classic "super-saw" sounds.
- **MMF (Multi-Mode Filter):** Add patchable filtering for dynamic lead or bass sounds.
- **Lo-Fi Effect:** Crunch or warp tones for digital or vintage texture.

## Installation Tips

- Align red stripe of power cable with the white line on the PCB.
- Use either row of 5 pins (on power connector) with proper stripe alignment.
- Secure with 2.5mm screws/nuts.
